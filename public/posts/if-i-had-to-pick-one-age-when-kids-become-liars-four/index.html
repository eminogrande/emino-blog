It isn’t.\nThis post is about a cognitive milestone: the moment children start treating your mind as something separate from their mind—a private “universe” with its own contents that can be influenced, misled, and sometimes exploited.\nA child who can lie is not automatically “bad.” A child who cannot lie is not automatically “good.” Lying is better understood as a social-technology that becomes possible once two pieces of machinery start working together:\nTheory of mind (ToM): tracking what someone else believes (even when it’s wrong). Executive function (EF): inhibiting the truth, holding the story in working memory, and controlling “leakage.” The hard part is that neither of these develops overnight. So why pick four?\nBecause around 4, multiple research lines converge on the same practical claim:\nchildren’s explicit false-belief understanding becomes reliable, self-protective lies in classic lab paradigms become common, and the ability to tell a lie and then keep it coherent begins to show up as an individual difference tied to ToM and EF. Below is the evidence that makes “four” the best single-number answer—even though reality is continuous.\nWhat counts as “lying” here (and what doesn’t) A big chunk of confusion comes from calling everything untrue a “lie.”\nIn developmental psychology, lying is usually defined as intentional verbal deception—not mistakes, misunderstandings, fantasy play, or random “yes” answers.\nOne widely cited definition puts it bluntly:\n“Lying involves a speaker making a false statement with the intention to deceive the recepient.” — Talwar \u0026 Lee (open-access full text on PMC)\nSo, “I didn’t break it” while holding the broken thing is a lie. “I have a dragon in my bedroom” (while playing) is not necessarily a lie. And “No” to every question isn’t lying; it’s often just response bias, fear, or confusion.\nWhy minds matter: the “other universe” problem Your question gestures at the key idea: at some point, a child realizes the other person has their own inner world.\nTo lie successfully, the child has to model:\nwhat really happened, and what you currently believe, and what you will believe after hearing their statement. That’s why false-belief understanding has been the workhorse test for ToM. And when researchers argue about “when ToM emerges,” they often argue about when children reliably pass false-belief tasks.\nA classic meta-analysis pulled together the messy literature:\n“A meta-analysis was conducted (N = 178 separate studies) to address the empirical inconsistencies and theoretical controversies.” — Wellman, Cross, \u0026 Watson (2001)\nand found that performance shows a consistent developmental pattern:\n“yielded a multiple R of .74 and an R2 of .55; thus, the model accounts for 55% of the variance” — Wellman, Cross, \u0026 Watson (2001)\nYou don’t have to treat false-belief tasks as perfect to accept the big message: preschoolers move from systematically failing these tasks to reliably passing them. That shift is exactly the kind of “other universe” upgrade that makes strategic lying possible.\nThe temptation-resistance paradigm: the lab’s “lying trap” Most of the cleanest child-lying data comes from a deceptively simple setup:\nTell the child don’t peek at a toy while you leave. Leave them alone (many peek). Ask: “Did you peek?” Optionally ask follow-ups that test whether they can maintain the lie (avoid “semantic leakage”). It’s called the temptation resistance paradigm (TRP).\nIn one open-access study of 150 children aged 3–8:\n“Overall, 82% of the children (123) peeked at the toy in the experimenter’s absence” — Talwar \u0026 Lee\nand among the peekers:\n“Of the 123 children who peeked, 79 (64%) children lied about their transgression.” — Talwar \u0026 Lee\nThat’s already a key point: lying is common once the situation pressures self-protection.\nBut it still doesn’t tell us the switch age. For that we look at the developmental model inside the same paper.\nThe reason I pick four: “secondary lies” start winning Talwar \u0026 Lee summarize a developmental progression often described in levels.\nWhat matters here is their claim about an inflection between 3 and 4:\n“The second level, ‘secondary lies’, reflects a significant shift that takes place between 3 and 4 years of age.” — Talwar \u0026 Lee\nAnd they make the practical statement you were asking for:\n“At and after 4 years of age, the majority of children will readily tell a lie to conceal their own transgression.” — Talwar \u0026 Lee\nThat sentence is why “four” is the best single-number answer.\nNot because every 4-year-old lies all the time. But because before 4, lying exists—yet it’s less reliable, less strategic, and more vulnerable to “leakage.” After 4, lying to conceal a misdeed becomes the modal response in these paradigms.\nWhy not pick 2.5? Because early “lies” look different Parents often report “first lies” around toddlerhood. Experiments see something related—but the pattern suggests it’s not yet full-strength, belief-manipulating deception.\nA large longitudinal study (N=252) tested 2.5-year-olds in a modified TRP and found:\n“Results showed that 35% of 2.5-year-olds peeked, 27% of peekers lied and 40% of non-peekers falsely confessed they had peeked.” — Białecka-Pikul et al. (2022)\nNotice how weird that is: 40% false confessions among non-peekers. That’s not a mature deception profile. It looks like a mix of compliance, confusion, or poor inhibitory control.\nThe authors’ interpretation is directly relevant:\n“These results suggested that the first, or so-called primary, lies of 2.5-year-olds are probably spontaneous, rather than deliberate.” — Białecka-Pikul et al. (2022)\nSo if you pick 2.5, you risk calling “noise” a “switch.”\nWhy not pick 7–8? Because that’s about skill, not onset There’s a different milestone later: the ability to keep the lie consistent under follow-up questioning.\nTalwar \u0026 Lee note that lie maintenance relates to higher-order belief understanding (thinking about what someone thinks about someone else’s beliefs). In other words: sophistication keeps developing.\nBut if your goal is the first age where lying becomes a common, deliberate concealment strategy, you don’t need to wait for 7–8. Four is earlier and captures the onset of secondary lies.\nThe “software update” view: ToM + EF predicts lying, but not strongly If lying were only theory-of-mind, we’d expect huge correlations. We don’t see that.\nWhat we see are small-but-consistent associations across thousands of children—exactly what you’d expect if ToM is necessary but not sufficient.\nA meta-analysis of lying and ToM (81 studies; 7,826 children) reports:\n“81 studies involving 7,826 children between 2 and 14 years of age” — Lee \u0026 Imuta (2021)\nand:\n“there was a small, significant positive association (r = .23).” — Lee \u0026 Imuta (2021)\nand importantly, the link is strongest where you’d expect ToM to matter most:\n“ToM was positively related to all facets of lying, but most strongly linked to lie maintenance” — Lee \u0026 Imuta (2021)\nA second meta-analysis that also includes executive function (47 papers; 5,099 participants) finds:\n“In total, 47 papers consisting of 5099 participants between 2 and 19 years of age were included” — Sai et al. (2021)\nand:\n“Statistically significant but relatively small effects were found between children’s lying and ToM (r = .17) and between lying and EF (r = .13).” — Sai et al. (2021)\nPlus a nuance that supports the “skill vs onset” distinction:\n“EF’s correlation with children’s initial lies was significantly smaller than its correlation with children’s ability to maintain lies.” — Sai et al. (2021)\nSo: around 4, the machinery is coming online. After that, children differ in how good they are—especially at maintaining a lie.\n“Does it stay?” Short-term stability shows up fast Even if lying “begins” around preschool, you asked something deeper: when does it become a stable behavior rather than a one-off?\nA short-term longitudinal paper (open access) tested 104 preschoolers three times across 4-month intervals:\n“we tested 104 normally developing children’s (64 boys, M = 54.0 months) false belief understanding and lie-telling behaviors three times at 4-month intervals.” — Wang, Gao, \u0026 Shao (2024)\nThey report:\n“Lie-telling behaviors exhibited moderate stability across the three time points” — Wang, Gao, \u0026 Shao (2024)\nAnd critically for the “other universe” theory, the direction of prediction runs from ToM to lying, not the other way:\n“Earlier false belief understanding significantly predicted children’s later lie-telling behavior” “earlier lie-telling did not predict later false beliefs understanding.” — Wang, Gao, \u0026 Shao (2024)\nIf you want “when it stays,” that kind of stability is the closest thing we have to a quantitative answer: once the behavior is common (post-4), it can already show measurable stability over months.\nLying doesn’t disappear in adulthood—but it becomes unevenly distributed If you follow lying into adult life, the story becomes less “everyone lies constantly” and more “most people lie rarely; a few people lie a lot.”\nA classic diary-study report:\n“77 college students reported telling 2 lies a day, and 70 community members told 1.” — DePaulo et al. (1996)\nAnd a large UK survey paper (N=2,980) summarizes the modern “long tail” view:\n“most people are honest most of the time and the majority of lies are told by a few prolific liars.” — Serota \u0026 Levine (2014)\nThey also state the sample clearly:\n“Participants (N = 2,980) were surveyed in the United Kingdom” — Serota \u0026 Levine (2014)\nSo yes: lying “stays” as a human behavior. But it doesn’t stay as a constant rate for everyone.\nSo: if I must choose one age, I choose 4 years old Here’s the clean argument.\n1) Before 4, deception exists but often looks like “primary” behavior Toddlers show denial, compliance errors, and false confessions in ways that suggest limited deliberate belief-manipulation (e.g., 2.5-year-olds: 27% of peekers lied; 40% of non-peekers falsely confessed).\n2) Around 4, deliberate concealment lies become the dominant response in classic paradigms Talwar \u0026 Lee explicitly describe a shift between 3 and 4 and state that at and after 4, the majority readily lie to conceal a transgression.\n3) Around 4, “other minds” become tractable objects False-belief performance shows a preschool conceptual change in a large meta-analysis; meta-analyses show ToM is reliably (if modestly) associated with lying, especially lie maintenance.\n4) After 4, context and incentives can swing honesty dramatically In 4–8-year-olds, changing appeals and punishment expectations moves lying rates from ~46% to ~87% in one dataset—meaning the behavior is now a strategic response, not just developmental noise.\n5) After 4, you can already detect stability over time Short-term longitudinal evidence finds moderate stability in lie-telling across multiple time points and shows ToM predicts later lying.\nIf you want a single age that best captures “the switch from truth-by-default to truth-as-a-strategy”, it’s four.\nCSV: key studies behind the “age 4” claim Copy/paste this as a .csv file.\nStudy,Year,Design,N,Age range,Paradigm / Measures,Key quantitative findings,Open link Wellman Cross Watson,\"2001\",Meta-analysis,\"178 studies (meta)\",Preschool focus,False-belief tasks,\"Model multiple R=.74;

tags: [&ldquo;psychology&rdquo;, &ldquo;child-development&rdquo;, &ldquo;lying&rdquo;, &ldquo;theory-of-mind&rdquo;]</h2><p><a href=https://youtu.be/bcu9MpjV3yE>https://youtu.be/bcu9MpjV3yE</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Thesis:</strong> If you force me to pick a single “switch” age when <em>lying becomes a stable, intentional tool</em> (not just noise, mistakes, or wishful answering), I pick <strong>4 years old</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>That sentence sounds like a moral diagnosis. It isn’t.</p><p>This post is about a cognitive milestone: the moment children start
treating <em>your mind</em> as something separate from <em>their mind</em>—a private
“universe” with its own contents that can be <strong>influenced</strong>,
<strong>misled</strong>, and sometimes <strong>exploited</strong>.</p><p>A child who can lie is not automatically “bad.” A child who <em>cannot</em>
lie is not automatically “good.” Lying is better understood as a
<strong>social-technology</strong> that becomes possible once two pieces of
machinery start working together:</p><ol><li><strong>Theory of mind</strong> (ToM): tracking what someone else believes (even
when it’s wrong).</li><li><strong>Executive function</strong> (EF): inhibiting the truth, holding the
story in working memory, and controlling “leakage.”</li></ol><p>The hard part is that neither of these develops overnight. So why pick <em>four</em>?</p><p>Because <strong>around 4</strong>, multiple research lines converge on the same
practical claim:</p><ul><li>children’s <strong>explicit false-belief understanding</strong> becomes reliable,</li><li><strong>self-protective lies</strong> in classic lab paradigms become common, and</li><li>the ability to tell a lie <em>and then keep it coherent</em> begins to show
up as an individual difference tied to ToM and EF.</li></ul><p>Below is the evidence that makes “four” the best single-number
answer—even though reality is continuous.</p><hr><h2 id=what-counts-as-lying-here-and-what-doesnt>What counts as “lying” here (and what doesn’t)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-counts-as-lying-here-and-what-doesnt>#</a></h2><p>A big chunk of confusion comes from calling everything untrue a “lie.”</p><p>In developmental psychology, <em>lying</em> is usually defined as
<strong>intentional verbal deception</strong>—not mistakes, misunderstandings,
fantasy play, or random “yes” answers.</p><p>One widely cited definition puts it bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>“Lying involves a speaker making a false statement with the intention to deceive the recepient.”
— Talwar & Lee (open-access full text on PMC)</p></blockquote><p>So, “I didn’t break it” while holding the broken thing is a lie.
“I have a dragon in my bedroom” (while playing) is not necessarily a lie.
And “No” to every question isn’t lying; it’s often just <strong>response
bias</strong>, <strong>fear</strong>, or <strong>confusion</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=why-minds-matter-the-other-universe-problem>Why <em>minds</em> matter: the “other universe” problem<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-minds-matter-the-other-universe-problem>#</a></h2><p>Your question gestures at the key idea: <em>at some point, a child
realizes the other person has their own inner world.</em></p><p>To lie successfully, the child has to model:</p><ul><li>what <em>really</em> happened, <strong>and</strong></li><li>what <em>you</em> currently believe, <strong>and</strong></li><li>what <em>you will believe</em> after hearing their statement.</li></ul><p>That’s why false-belief understanding has been the workhorse test for
ToM. And when researchers argue about “when ToM emerges,” they often
argue about when children reliably pass false-belief tasks.</p><p>A classic meta-analysis pulled together the messy literature:</p><blockquote><p>“A meta-analysis was conducted (N = 178 separate studies) to address the empirical inconsistencies and theoretical controversies.”
— Wellman, Cross, & Watson (2001)</p></blockquote><p>and found that performance shows a consistent developmental pattern:</p><blockquote><p>“yielded a multiple R of .74 and an R2 of .55; thus, the model accounts for 55% of the variance”
— Wellman, Cross, & Watson (2001)</p></blockquote><p>You don’t have to treat false-belief tasks as perfect to accept the
big message: preschoolers move from systematically failing these tasks
to reliably passing them. That shift is exactly the kind of “other
universe” upgrade that makes strategic lying possible.</p><hr><h2 id=the-temptation-resistance-paradigm-the-labs-lying-trap>The temptation-resistance paradigm: the lab’s “lying trap”<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-temptation-resistance-paradigm-the-labs-lying-trap>#</a></h2><p>Most of the cleanest child-lying data comes from a deceptively simple setup:</p><ol><li>Tell the child <strong>don’t peek</strong> at a toy while you leave.</li><li>Leave them alone (many peek).</li><li>Ask: <strong>“Did you peek?”</strong></li><li>Optionally ask follow-ups that test whether they can maintain the
lie (avoid “semantic leakage”).</li></ol><p>It’s called the <strong>temptation resistance paradigm (TRP)</strong>.</p><p>In one open-access study of 150 children aged 3–8:</p><blockquote><p>“Overall, 82% of the children (123) peeked at the toy in the experimenter’s absence”
— Talwar & Lee</p></blockquote><p>and among the peekers:</p><blockquote><p>“Of the 123 children who peeked, 79 (64%) children lied about their transgression.”
— Talwar & Lee</p></blockquote><p>That’s already a key point: <strong>lying is common once the situation
pressures self-protection</strong>.</p><p>But it still doesn’t tell us <em>the switch age</em>. For that we look at the
developmental model inside the same paper.</p><hr><h2 id=the-reason-i-pick-four-secondary-lies-start-winning>The reason I pick <strong>four</strong>: “secondary lies” start winning<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-reason-i-pick-four-secondary-lies-start-winning>#</a></h2><p>Talwar & Lee summarize a developmental progression often described in levels.</p><p>What matters here is their claim about an inflection between 3 and 4:</p><blockquote><p>“The second level, ‘secondary lies’, reflects a significant shift that takes place between 3 and 4 years of age.”
— Talwar & Lee</p></blockquote><p>And they make the practical statement you were asking for:</p><blockquote><p>“At and after 4 years of age, the majority of children will readily tell a lie to conceal their own transgression.”
— Talwar & Lee</p></blockquote><p>That sentence is why “four” is the best single-number answer.</p><p>Not because every 4-year-old lies all the time.
But because <em>before</em> 4, lying exists—yet it’s less reliable, less
strategic, and more vulnerable to “leakage.”
After 4, <em>lying to conceal a misdeed becomes the modal response</em> in
these paradigms.</p><hr><h2 id=why-not-pick-25-because-early-lies-look-different>Why not pick 2.5? Because early “lies” look different<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-not-pick-25-because-early-lies-look-different>#</a></h2><p>Parents often report “first lies” around toddlerhood. Experiments see
something related—but the pattern suggests it’s not yet full-strength,
belief-manipulating deception.</p><p>A large longitudinal study (N=252) tested 2.5-year-olds in a modified
TRP and found:</p><blockquote><p>“Results showed that 35% of 2.5-year-olds peeked, 27% of peekers lied and 40% of non-peekers falsely confessed they had peeked.”
— Białecka-Pikul et al. (2022)</p></blockquote><p>Notice how weird that is: <strong>40% false confessions</strong> among non-peekers.
That’s not a mature deception profile. It looks like a mix of
compliance, confusion, or poor inhibitory control.</p><p>The authors’ interpretation is directly relevant:</p><blockquote><p>“These results suggested that the first, or so-called primary, lies of 2.5-year-olds are probably spontaneous, rather than deliberate.”
— Białecka-Pikul et al. (2022)</p></blockquote><p>So if you pick 2.5, you risk calling “noise” a “switch.”</p><hr><h2 id=why-not-pick-78-because-thats-about-skill-not-onset>Why not pick 7–8? Because that’s about <em>skill</em>, not <em>onset</em><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-not-pick-78-because-thats-about-skill-not-onset>#</a></h2><p>There’s a different milestone later: the ability to keep the lie
consistent under follow-up questioning.</p><p>Talwar & Lee note that lie maintenance relates to higher-order belief
understanding (thinking about what someone thinks about someone else’s
beliefs). In other words: <strong>sophistication</strong> keeps developing.</p><p>But if your goal is the first age where lying becomes a common,
deliberate concealment strategy, you don’t need to wait for 7–8. Four
is earlier and captures the onset of <em>secondary lies</em>.</p><hr><h2 id=the-software-update-view-tom--ef-predicts-lying-but-not-strongly>The “software update” view: ToM + EF predicts lying, but not strongly<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-software-update-view-tom--ef-predicts-lying-but-not-strongly>#</a></h2><p>If lying were <em>only</em> theory-of-mind, we’d expect huge correlations. We
don’t see that.</p><p>What we see are small-but-consistent associations across thousands of
children—exactly what you’d expect if ToM is necessary but not
sufficient.</p><p>A meta-analysis of lying and ToM (81 studies; 7,826 children) reports:</p><blockquote><p>“81 studies involving 7,826 children between 2 and 14 years of age”
— Lee & Imuta (2021)</p></blockquote><p>and:</p><blockquote><p>“there was a small, significant positive association (r = .23).”
— Lee & Imuta (2021)</p></blockquote><p>and importantly, the link is strongest where you’d expect ToM to matter most:</p><blockquote><p>“ToM was positively related to all facets of lying, but most strongly linked to lie maintenance”
— Lee & Imuta (2021)</p></blockquote><p>A second meta-analysis that also includes executive function (47
papers; 5,099 participants) finds:</p><blockquote><p>“In total, 47 papers consisting of 5099 participants between 2 and 19 years of age were included”
— Sai et al. (2021)</p></blockquote><p>and:</p><blockquote><p>“Statistically significant but relatively small effects were found between children’s lying and ToM (r = .17) and between lying and EF (r = .13).”
— Sai et al. (2021)</p></blockquote><p>Plus a nuance that supports the “skill vs onset” distinction:</p><blockquote><p>“EF’s correlation with children’s initial lies was significantly smaller than its correlation with children’s ability to maintain lies.”
— Sai et al. (2021)</p></blockquote><p>So: around 4, the machinery is coming online. After that, children
differ in <em>how good</em> they are—especially at maintaining a lie.</p><hr><h2 id=does-it-stay-short-term-stability-shows-up-fast>“Does it stay?” Short-term stability shows up fast<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#does-it-stay-short-term-stability-shows-up-fast>#</a></h2><p>Even if lying “begins” around preschool, you asked something deeper:
when does it become a stable behavior rather than a one-off?</p><p>A short-term longitudinal paper (open access) tested 104 preschoolers
three times across 4-month intervals:</p><blockquote><p>“we tested 104 normally developing children’s (64 boys, M = 54.0 months) false belief understanding and lie-telling behaviors three times at 4-month intervals.”
— Wang, Gao, & Shao (2024)</p></blockquote><p>They report:</p><blockquote><p>“Lie-telling behaviors exhibited moderate stability across the three time points”
— Wang, Gao, & Shao (2024)</p></blockquote><p>And critically for the “other universe” theory, the direction of
prediction runs from ToM to lying, not the other way:</p><blockquote><p>“Earlier false belief understanding significantly predicted children’s later lie-telling behavior”
“earlier lie-telling did not predict later false beliefs understanding.”
— Wang, Gao, & Shao (2024)</p></blockquote><p>If you want “when it stays,” that kind of stability is the closest
thing we have to a quantitative answer: once the behavior is common
(post-4), it can already show measurable stability over months.</p><hr><h2 id=lying-doesnt-disappear-in-adulthoodbut-it-becomes-unevenly-distributed>Lying doesn’t disappear in adulthood—but it becomes <em>unevenly distributed</em><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lying-doesnt-disappear-in-adulthoodbut-it-becomes-unevenly-distributed>#</a></h2><p>If you follow lying into adult life, the story becomes less “everyone
lies constantly” and more “most people lie rarely; a few people lie a
lot.”</p><p>A classic diary-study report:</p><blockquote><p>“77 college students reported telling 2 lies a day, and 70 community members told 1.”
— DePaulo et al. (1996)</p></blockquote><p>And a large UK survey paper (N=2,980) summarizes the modern “long tail” view:</p><blockquote><p>“most people are honest most of the time and the majority of lies are told by a few prolific liars.”
— Serota & Levine (2014)</p></blockquote><p>They also state the sample clearly:</p><blockquote><p>“Participants (N = 2,980) were surveyed in the United Kingdom”
— Serota & Levine (2014)</p></blockquote><p>So yes: lying “stays” as a human behavior. But it doesn’t stay as a
constant rate for everyone.</p><hr><h2 id=so-if-i-must-choose-one-age-i-choose-4-years-old>So: if I must choose one age, I choose <strong>4 years old</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#so-if-i-must-choose-one-age-i-choose-4-years-old>#</a></h2><p>Here’s the clean argument.</p><h3 id=1-before-4-deception-exists-but-often-looks-like-primary-behavior>1) Before 4, deception exists but often looks like “primary” behavior<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-before-4-deception-exists-but-often-looks-like-primary-behavior>#</a></h3><p>Toddlers show denial, compliance errors, and false confessions in ways
