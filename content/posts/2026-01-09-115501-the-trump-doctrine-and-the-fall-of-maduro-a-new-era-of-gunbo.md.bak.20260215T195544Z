# The Trump Doctrine and the Fall of Maduro: A New Era of Gunboat Diplomacy?

The dramatic events of January 3, 2026, when Venezuelan President
Nicolás Maduro was removed from his residence in Caracas, have sent
shockwaves through the international community. In a profound
analysis, PLO Lumumba explores the implications of this action,
framing it as the "death of international law" and the birth of a
starkly unilateral "Trump Doctrine."

## A Rehash of Gunboat Diplomacy

Lumumba argues that the removal of Maduro is a modern manifestation of
the Monroe Doctrine, updated for the 21st century. He suggests that
while the 19th-century doctrine targeted European powers, the current
**Trump Doctrine** asserts absolute American hegemony.

Echoing Otto von Bismarck’s "blood and iron," Lumumba notes that
today's global issues are being resolved not through resolutions or UN
speeches, but through **missiles, drones, and warships**. In this
view, the United States has positioned itself as the world’s ultimate
judge, jury, and executioner.

## The Resource Factor: Oil and Colonization

At the heart of this regime change, according to Lumumba, lies
Venezuela’s vast natural resources. He asserts that the U.S. move is a
form of **classical colonization** aimed at securing the world's
largest oil reserves.

By installing a puppet or "satellite" administration, the U.S. seeks
to ensure that American companies exploit Venezuelan oil under the
guise of "running" the country for its own good. Lumumba warns that
this transactional foreign policy turns sovereign nations into guinea
pigs for American interests.

## "Give a Dog a Bad Name": The Charges of Narco-Terrorism

The justification for Maduro’s arrest—**narco-terrorism**—is viewed by
Lumumba as a tactical label used to delegitimize a foreign leader. He
compares this to the historical precedents of:

* **Manuel Noriega** in Panama
* **Saddam Hussein** in Iraq
* **Muammar Gaddafi** in Libya

He suggests that the narco-terrorism tag is a way to ensure the target
is "dead on arrival" in the court of public opinion, regardless of the
evidence. Lumumba points out the irony in these charges, noting that
the demand side of the drug trade remains unaddressed within the
United States itself.

## Precision and Betrayal

How was such a significant operation carried out with laser-pointed
success and zero U.S. casualties? Lumumba theorizes that Maduro was
**betrayed from within** his own inner circle.

He suggests that covert CIA activities likely "softened the ground" by
recruiting critical human assets within the Venezuelan forces, leading
to a pinpointed operation that required "not even a bullet fired."

## The Future of Venezuela: Satellite State or Sovereignty?

With Vice President Rodriguez serving as interim president, Lumumba
predicts a period of **administration by intimidation**. He foresees a
"kangaroo process" trial for Maduro resulting in a long-term
conviction, followed by a potential pardon under a future U.S.
administration once political goals are met.

While sanctions may be lifted to improve the immediate quality of life
for Venezuelans, Lumumba warns that the true cost is the loss of
national spirit and independence. Ultimately, his analysis serves as a
warning: if the **"law of the jungle"** replaces international law, no
nation is truly safe from the whims of a nuclear superpower.
