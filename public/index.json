AI search optimization refers to making your content easily discoverable and understandable by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini. Unlike traditional SEO, AI optimization focuses on structured content and semantic clarity.\nKey Strategies for AI Optimization 1. Implement llms.txt Create an llms.txt file at your domain root that tells AI systems about your most important content.\n2. Use Clear Hierarchical Structure AI systems prefer content with clear heading hierarchies:\nH1: Main topic H2: Major sections H3: Subsections H4: Details 3. Provide Structured Data Use JSON-LD schema markup to help AI understand your content type and structure.\n4. Create Topic Clusters Group related content together:\nWrite comprehensive guides on specific topics Link between related articles Cover topics from multiple angles 5. Optimize robots.txt for AI Crawlers Allow AI crawlers explicitly in your robots.txt file.\nMeasuring AI Search Performance Track these metrics:\nReferral traffic from AI platforms Brand mentions in AI-generated responses Citation frequency in AI answers Best Practices Write in clear, concise language Use markdown formatting for code examples Include Q\u0026amp;A sections in your content Update content regularly to maintain relevance Provide comprehensive answers to common questions Conclusion AI search optimization is becoming increasingly important as more users rely on AI assistants for information.

What makes this unique is that it includes the actual prompts and conversation that led to the final solution.\nThe Initial Problem Users First Prompt:\n\u0026ldquo;can you ssh into ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner_ubuntu_ed25519 root@188.34.194.25 echo Connected! ?\u0026rdquo;\nThe journey began with a simple SSH connection test to a Hetzner server. The connection worked, confirming we had server access.\nUsers Second Prompt:\n\u0026ldquo;can you check why my domain emino.app is not connected and https does not work and https does not work? can you make it work and connect it to a blog, i want a blog, maybe ghost blog, that is optimized for LLM search and ai search optimization so chatgpt can find and index it easy, i was thinking to work primarily with markdown files, and slowly add features and functionality, and have my blog and files on github and also rendered as a nice blog, what would you suggest i use ? maybe go with github pages directly or rather self-host something here - what do you think gets the best indexing and attention? do some websearch and ideas first dont code\u0026rdquo;\nThis revealed the full scope: fixing DNS issues, setting up a blog, and optimizing it for AI discovery.\nPart 1: Diagnosing the DNS Problem Initial Investigation First, we checked the domain status:\ndig emino.app +short # Returned: 44.227.65.245, 44.227.76.166 (AWS IPs) curl -I https://emino.app # SSL handshake failure The domain was pointing to AWS servers instead of the Hetzner server (188.34.194.25).\nChecking Server Configuration # On the server nginx -v # nginx/1.24.0 ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ # Found: emino.app configuration certbot certificates # Valid certificates existed, expiring Nov 21, 2025 The server was properly configured with:\nNginx set up for emino.app Valid Lets Encrypt SSL certificates Proper site configuration The DNS Root Cause nslookup -type=NS emino.app # Nameservers: Porkbun (curitiba.ns.porkbun.com, etc.) User then shared a screenshot of Porkbun DNS settings showing:\nALIAS record pointing to pixie.porkbun.com CNAME for *.emino.app also pointing to pixie.porkbun.com This was the issue! The domain was using ALIAS/CNAME records pointing to AWS servers instead of A records pointing to the Hetzner server.\nPart 2: Research - Why Self-Host Over GitHub Pages? AI/LLM Optimization Research Findings Based on web searches conducted during the session, heres why self-hosting beats GitHub Pages for AI indexing:\nSelf-Hosting Advantages:\nFull control over robots.txt and AI crawler configurations Ability to implement llms.txt and llms-full.txt files properly Better performance metrics (affects AI ranking) Custom headers for AI user agents (ChatGPT-User, Claude-Web, etc.) Pre-rendering capabilities for JavaScript content More flexibility for schema markup and structured data The llms.txt Revolution What is llms.txt?\nIntroduced by Jeremy Howard in September 2024 A simple text file that helps LLMs find and understand your most important content Similar to robots.txt but specifically for AI systems Should be placed at domain root (e.g., https://example.com/llms.txt) Key Benefits:\nImproves factual accuracy of AI responses about your content Increases relevance to search queries Creates more complete AI responses Better documentation visibility Can increase referral traffic from AI platforms by 800%+ (per research) Why Hugo? Hugo emerged as the best static site generator for AI optimization because:\nBlazing fast builds (milliseconds, not seconds) Native markdown support (AI models prefer markdown) Clean HTML output (better for AI parsing) Built-in SEO features Static output (perfect for AI crawling) Part 3: The Implementation Step 1: Fixing DNS Users Prompt:\n\u0026ldquo;done now lets get onto hugo, and setting up the blog also on my github, and the actions, all you suggested, and create some script that always check that my blog is in super health and super optimized and no broken links and perfect seo\u0026rdquo;\nAfter the user updated DNS from ALIAS/CNAME to A records pointing to 188.34.194.25:\n# DNS propagation check dig emino.app +short # Now returns: 188.34.194.25 ✓ # HTTPS test curl -I https://emino.app # HTTP/2 404 (expected, no content yet) Step 2: Installing Hugo # Initial attempt with snap had permission issues snap install hugo # Had /var/lib/snapd/void permission errors # Solution: Install from .deb package wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.148.2/hugo_extended_0.148.2_linux-amd64.deb dpkg -i hugo_extended_0.148.2_linux-amd64.deb Step 3: Creating the Hugo Site Structure cd /var/www hugo new site emino-blog cd emino-blog git init # Install PaperMod theme for clean SEO git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod Step 4: AI-Optimized Configuration Created hugo.toml with AI-focused settings:\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;https://emino.app/\u0026#34;
