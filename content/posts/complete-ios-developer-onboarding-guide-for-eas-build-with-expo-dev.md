# Enter personal Expo credentials (not company's)
```

### 13. Clone and Setup Project
```bash

```

## Phase 3: First Development Build

### 14. Verify EAS Configuration
```bash
# Check that eas.json exists and has development profile
cat eas.json
```

### 15. Create Development Build
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```
- EAS automatically uses company's stored credentials
- Wait for build to complete (10-20 minutes)
- Build appears in Expo dashboard

## Phase 4: Device Setup (Developer's iPhone)

### 16. Enable Developer Mode (iOS 16+)
- Settings → Privacy & Security
- Scroll to "Developer Mode" (won't appear until step 17 fails first)
- Toggle ON
- Device will restart
- After restart: confirm "Turn On Developer Mode"
- Enter device passcode

### 17. Install Development Build
- Open EAS dashboard in Safari on iPhone
- Or get direct link from terminal after build completes
- Tap "Install" on the build
- If Developer Mode not enabled, it will fail (go back to step 16)

### 18. Trust Developer Certificate

- Find profile under "Developer App"
- Tap company name profile
- Tap "Trust [Company Name]"
- Confirm trust

### 19. Launch App
- App icon appears on home screen
- Tap to open
- App should run successfully

## Phase 5: Daily Development Workflow

### 20. Start Development Server
```bash
# In project directory
npx expo start --dev-client
```

### 21. Connect Device to Development Server
- Ensure iPhone and computer on same WiFi
- Open installed app on iPhone
- App connects to Metro bundler
- See live updates as you code

### 22. Creating New Builds
```bash
# Development build (for testing)
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Preview build (for internal testing)
eas build --profile preview --platform ios

# Production build (for App Store)
eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

### 23. Submitting to TestFlight
```bash
# After production build completes
eas submit -p ios
```
