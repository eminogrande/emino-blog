The life of Pablo Picasso presents a jarring paradox: a man of unprecedented creative output and financial success who was, by many accounts, a "monster of assured egoism."

Based on the video's analysis of Paul Johnson’s essay, here is a ranking of the "bad and crazy" facts about Pablo Picasso, ordered from his most disturbing/negative behaviors to his most impressive/positive achievements.

## The Most Negative & Disturbing Behaviors

- **Physical Violence:** Picasso’s most gifted mistress was reportedly beaten by him and left unconscious on the floor.
- **Psychological Sadism:** He took pleasure in hurting women and would intentionally create situations where his mistresses would confront each other. He once watched two of them fight physically on the floor while he calmly continued to paint.
- **The "Goddess to Doormat" Philosophy:** He explicitly stated that for him, women were either "goddesses or doormats," and his personal goal was to systematically transform a "goddess" into a "doormat".
- **Sociopathic Betrayal:** He would steal his friends' wives and then tell the husband that he was "honoring" him by choosing to sleep with her.
- **Lack of Moral Compass:** The author describes Picasso as lacking the basic human ability to distinguish between right and wrong or truth and falsehood, viewing kindness and generosity as mere weaknesses to be exploited.
- **A Tragic Family Legacy:** His personal cruelty left a dark mark on his family; after his death, his widow committed suicide by shooting herself, and his eldest son died of alcoholism.

## The "Crazy" & Arrogant Traits

- **God Complex:** He was frequently overheard repeating the phrase "I am God, I am God" to himself.
- **Imposter Syndrome or Self-Awareness:** Despite his fame, he would periodically admit, "I am nothing but a clown," suggesting he occasionally felt his massive success was a "con".

## The "Impressive" (Positive) Feats of Genius & Wealth

- **Superhuman Productivity:** Between the ages of 20 and 91, Picasso averaged one new piece of artwork every single day. Over 71 years, he produced a staggering **26,075** published works.
- **Unparalleled Financial Success:** He was a master of marketing who "always knew what would sell." He became a millionaire by **1914** and died as the wealthiest artist in history.
- **Pure Focus:** While his monumental selfishness destroyed his personal life, it provided him with an all-inspiring level of focus that helped him revolutionize the visual experience of the 20th century.

## A few more facts (worth knowing)

- **Constant reinvention:** Picasso repeatedly changed styles and broke his own rules—part of why he stayed culturally dominant for decades.
- **Work ethic as a weapon:** He treated output like a compulsion; for him, creating was closer to breathing than to "inspiration."
- **Relentless self-mythmaking:** He cultivated a persona as carefully as he made paintings—he understood fame as a medium.
- **He kept everything:** Picasso saved vast amounts of work and material, which helped cement his historical footprint (and later fueled a huge estate).
- **Public genius, private wreckage:** The same traits that made him unstoppable in art made him brutal in relationships.
