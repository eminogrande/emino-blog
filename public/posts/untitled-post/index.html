An open call to artists, DJs, producers, architects, sound

Dar es Salaam is not “the next big city.” It’s the city that is
already arriving—fast.
The question is whether the cultural infrastructure will arrive with it.
Today, Dar es Salaam Region has 5,383,728 people (2022 census)—up
from 4,364,541 in 2012. Youth dominate the population: 37.1% are
below 18, and 21.9% are 15–24. The median age is 23.1.
That means: millions of teenagers and young adults are coming of age
right now—and the city urgently needs safe, well‑run spaces where
they can gather, dance, learn, create, and belong."><meta name=author content="Emin Henri Mahrt"><link rel=canonical href=https://emino.app/posts/untitled-post/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://emino.app/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://emino.app/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://emino.app/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://emino.app/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://emino.app/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://emino.app/posts/untitled-post/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://emino.app/posts/untitled-post/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Emino.App's, Art's & Articles by Emin Mahrt"><meta property="og:title" content="Untitled Post"><meta property="og:description" content="Dar es Salaam Needs a World‑Class Safe Dance Space An open call to artists, DJs, producers, architects, sound engineers, and cultural organisers

Youth dominate the population: 37.1% are below 18, and 21.9% are 15–24. The median age is 23.1. That means: millions of teenagers and young adults are coming of age right now—and the city urgently needs safe, well‑run spaces where they can gather, dance, learn, create, and belong.\nThis is a call to build a venue in Dar es Salaam that feels, in spirit, like what Berghain or Club der Visionäre represent in Berlin: not a copy of Berlin—a Dar es Salaam original—but a space with the same seriousness about sound, community, and freedom.\n1) Why Dar es Salaam, why now Different datasets use different boundaries (city, region, metro, “urban agglomeration”). But they all point in one direction: Dar is growing at extraordinary speed.\nOne major projection set has Dar es Salaam growing from roughly ~6 million to ~13.4 million by 2035, crossing 10 million before 2030. The World Economic Forum has also listed Dar among the world’s fastest‑growing cities, projecting ~100% growth between 2020 and 2035. This is the urban story of our era: a coastal metropolis expanding, densifying, migrating, remixing itself. And in fast‑growing cities, cultural spaces are not “nice to have”—they are pressure valves, community anchors, and engines of identity.\n2) A city of youth (and youth migration) The 2022 census profile for Dar es Salaam Region shows a profoundly young city:\nMedian age: 23.1 (2022) 31.5% are below 15 37.1% are below 18 21.9% are 15–24 The population pyramid shows a bulge at ages 20–29, indicating youth in‑migration from other parts of Tanzania. This matters for nightlife and “third places” (spaces beyond home/school/work): Dar doesn’t just have young people—it has a continuous wave of young people arriving, looking for community, opportunity, and meaning.\nIf we don’t create safe cultural spaces for this generation, the city will still “party”—but it will do so in fragmented, precarious, sometimes unsafe ways. We can do better.\n3) The future sound is already here: Singeli and Dar’s underground Dar es Salaam has already produced one of the most radical dance forms on the planet: Singeli—ultra‑fast, MC‑driven, street‑born, wildly innovative.\nUNESCO hosted a national capacity‑building workshop in Dar es Salaam (March 2025) connected to Tanzania’s intangible cultural heritage nomination work for Singeli. Music journalism and regional platforms have documented Singeli’s rise from late‑2000s working‑class districts into a sound that now travels globally. So this isn’t about importing culture. It’s about building infrastructure that matches the culture already being created in Dar—and giving young artists real stages, real sound, real respect, and real pay.\n4) What we mean by “a Berghain / Visionäre‑level space” Not the door policy. Not the hype. Not the myth.\nWe mean the fundamentals:\nWorld‑class sound (serious system, serious room treatment, serious engineers) Long-form musical journeys (space for DJs and live acts to develop narratives, not just “hits”) Community-first design (dancefloor + chill spaces + water + ventilation + toilets that work) Care culture (anti-harassment, de-escalation, consent, first aid, safe rides home) Local roots + global exchange (Dar artists centered; international guests invited to learn, collaborate, and share) A place where a young person can walk in and feel:\n“I am safe here. I can be myself here. I can dance here. I can grow here.”\n5) The project (working title): DAR LISTENING ROOM A club + community venue designed around safety, sound, and youth culture Core idea: A hybrid space that can hold club nights, live showcases, workshops, open decks, producer labs, and community gatherings—with a strong focus on 18+ youth and the artists shaping the next decade.\nProgramming pillars 18+ nights (clear age checks; a culture that protects younger adults from exploitation) Local-first lineups (Singeli, Bongo Flava, experimental, techno, house, amapiano, live percussion, spoken word) Skill-building: DJ classes, MC workshops, sound engineering mentorship, lighting design training Residencies for emerging DJs/MCs/producers (monthly residents, paid, mentored) Sober-friendly events (the dancefloor should not require intoxication) Safety pillars (non-negotiable) A published Code of Care: no harassment, no violence, no coercion Trained staff for de-escalation + clear reporting channels Free water, clear exits, ventilation, and medical/first-aid readiness Partnerships for safe transport home after events Economic pillars Transparent artist pay standards Fair local employment (security, bar, cleaning, technicians) Ticket models that keep entry affordable (community tickets / student nights / early-bird tiers) A plan to reinvest a portion of profits into youth training + local cultural grants 6) Doing it legally and respectfully in Dar (a reality check) A club is not just vibes; it’s governance.\nAnyone building this in Dar should plan for:\nBusiness licensing in Tanzania (different classes and issuing authorities exist). Public performance / music licensing (Tanzania has a collecting society framework; clubs typically need to pay music royalties). Event permits: new regulations have been reported for arts/event permits with fees linked to ticket price bands. Alcohol licensing \u0026 age rules: Tanzania’s Intoxicating Liquors Act includes offences related to supplying alcohol to people under 16; regardless, we can choose an 18+ house policy for entry and alcohol service for safety and clarity. Important: This post is not legal advice. The point is simple: we build in partnership with local expertise, and we build in compliance—because safety depends on it.\n7) What we’re asking for (this is the call) If you are any of the following—we want you in this:\nArtists \u0026 music people DJs (local + international), MCs, live acts Producers willing to teach / mentor Label heads and radio people who can amplify Dar artists globally Event producers \u0026 operators Night managers, stage managers, production leads Door teams trained in care, not intimidation Community organisers who understand youth needs Space makers Architects who know heat, airflow, crowd movement Acoustic engineers and system techs Lighting designers, builders, fabricators Partners \u0026 supporters Local cultural institutions, community groups, youth organisations Ethical investors / patrons (patient capital, transparent terms) Brands that can support without controlling the culture The rule: local leadership isn’t optional. This must be built with Dar, not for Dar.\n8) First steps (a realistic roadmap) Phase 0: Listening (0–2 months) Build a local steering circle (artists + producers + community voices) Host listening sessions in Dar: “What would a safe club look like here?” Map legal requirements and identify a local legal/operations advisor Phase 1: Pop‑ups (2–6 months) Run small, legal pilot events (workshops + nights) Test sound + staffing + safety protocols Build trust with audiences, neighbors, authorities, and partners Phase 2: Permanent home (6–18 months) Secure a venue location with good access + noise strategy Install sound properly (don’t improvise this) Launch with a resident program and a monthly calendar 9) The peaceful revolution (what this is really about) A “club” can be shallow. But a well‑run cultural space can be a civic project:\nIt gives youth a safe place to gather It creates jobs and creative careers It builds pride and belonging It turns tension into expression It turns isolation into community Music won’t fix everything. But it can change how a city feels at night— and that changes what a city becomes.\nJoin the build If you want to help build this in Dar es Salaam:\nEmail: [YOUR EMAIL] Instagram: [YOUR IG] Interest form: [YOUR FORM LINK] If you’re in Dar: drop a message to meet in person.

develop narratives, not just “hits”)</li><li><strong>Community-first design</strong> (dancefloor + chill spaces + water +
ventilation + toilets that work)</li><li><strong>Care culture</strong> (anti-harassment, de-escalation, consent, first
aid, safe rides home)</li><li><strong>Local roots + global exchange</strong> (Dar artists centered;
international guests invited to learn, collaborate, and share)</li></ul><p>A place where a young person can walk in and feel:</p><blockquote><p>“I am safe here. I can be myself here.
