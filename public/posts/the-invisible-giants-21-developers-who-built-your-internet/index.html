We often praise the founders of Facebook or Google, but the modern
internet is actually built on a foundation of open-source code
maintained by a small group of volunteers. These are the &ldquo;Invisible
Giants.&rdquo; You likely use their code every single day without realizing
it.
Here is the story of the top 21, starting with the master of the file system.
1. The Watchman: Paul Millr

Handle: @paulmillr
The Crown Jewel: chokidar
The Numbers: Used in over 30 million repositories; hundreds
of millions of downloads.
The Story: In the early days of Node.js, the simple act of
&ldquo;watching&rdquo; a file for changes (so your app could reload automatically)
was broken. It was buggy, crashed on Macs, and ignored errors on
Windows. Paul didn&rsquo;t just accept this; he built Chokidar.
Why it’s special: It solved the most painful part of the
developer experience: waiting. Every time you hit Ctrl+S in VS Code,
or your React app instantly updates in the browser, that is Paul’s
code running in the background, efficiently watching the world for
you.


2. The King of Productivity: Sindre Sorhus

Handle: @sindresorhus
The Crown Jewel: chalk
The Numbers: 1.9 Billion+ downloads.
The Story: Sindre is a legend who believes in the &ldquo;Unix
Philosophy&rdquo;: small modules that do one thing well. His most famous
creation, Chalk, brought color to the terminal.
Why it’s special: Before Sindre, the terminal was a bleak,
black-and-white wall of text. He made errors red, warnings yellow, and
success green. He literally colored the developer&rsquo;s world, reducing
eye strain and confusion for millions.

3. The Master of Micro-Utils: Jon Schlinkert

Handle: @jonschlinkert
The Crown Jewel:
micromatch
The Numbers: 1.3 Billion+ downloads.
The Story: Jon is the master of &ldquo;matching.&rdquo; If you have ever
typed *.js to find all JavaScript files, or src/**/*.css to find
styles, you are using Jon&rsquo;s logic.
Why it’s special: His code is the invisible sorting machine
inside Webpack, Babel, and ESLint. He ensures that when you ask for a
file, the computer actually finds the right one.

4. The Partner in Code: Brian Woodward

Handle: @doowb
The Crown Jewel:
handlebars-helpers
The Numbers: 860 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Often working in tandem with Jon Schlinkert, Brian
builds the glue that holds static sites together.
Why it’s special: He provides the &ldquo;helpers&rdquo; that allow
templating engines to function—formatting dates, looping through data,
and automating repetitive HTML tasks. He is the reason your blog
generator works.

5. The Modernizer: Daniel Tschinder

Handle: @danez
The Crown Jewel: babel-plugin-transform...
The Numbers: 774 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Daniel is a core pillar of the Babel team. Babel
is the &ldquo;time machine&rdquo; of the web; it lets you write futuristic code
today and converts it into code that older browsers can understand.
Why it’s special: Without Daniel, we would still be writing
archaic JavaScript (ES5). He allows the entire industry to move
forward without leaving users on older computers behind.

6. The Babel Keeper: Henry Zhu

Handle: @hzoo
The Crown Jewel: babel-core
The Numbers: 743 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Henry is the face of open-source sustainability. As
the lead maintainer of Babel, he manages the compiler that powers
React, Vue, and Next.js.
Why it’s special: He holds the keys to the kingdom. If Babel
breaks, the modern web breaks. His &ldquo;package&rdquo; is actually the peace of
mind that your code will run anywhere, on any device.

7. The Architect: Logan Smyth

Handle: @loganfsmyth
The Crown Jewel:
babel-loader
The Numbers: 739 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Logan builds the bridges. He specializes in how Babel
talks to other tools, specifically Webpack.
Why it’s special: He created the translation layer that
connects your build system to the compiler. He makes sure the complex
&ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; of modern web development flows smoothly without clogging.

8. The Father of NPM: Isaac Z. Schlueter

Handle: @isaacs
The Crown Jewel:
glob (and created npm)
The Numbers: 736 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Isaac is royalty. He created npm itself. However,
his most downloaded package is glob, which teaches Node.js how to
find files on a hard drive using patterns.
Why it’s special: He didn&rsquo;t just write a package; he built the
playground everyone else on this list is playing in. Every time you
run npm install, you are using his invention.

9. The AST Surgeon: Brian Ng

Handle: @existentialism
The Crown Jewel: babel-types
The Numbers: 685 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Brian’s work allows software to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; other
software. He maintains the tools that dissect code into Abstract
Syntax Trees (ASTs).
Why it’s special: His tools don&rsquo;t just read code; they
surgically alter it. This is what allows tools to automatically fix
your bugs or format your messy code.

10. The Server Savior: Doug Wilson

Handle: @dougwilson
The Crown Jewel: express
The Numbers: 668 Million+ downloads.
The Story: If you have ever visited a website powered by
Node.js, it was likely running on Express. Doug has been the tireless
maintainer of the standard web framework for Node.
Why it’s special: He keeps the internet running. From small
blogs to massive APIs, his code handles the request and sends the
response.

11. The Creator: Sebastian McKenzie

Handle: @sebmck
The Crown Jewel: yarn
(and created Babel)
The Numbers: 632 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Sebastian is a prodigy. He created Babel (originally
6to5) as a teenager and then created Yarn, a faster alternative
to npm.
Why it’s special: He single-handedly dragged JavaScript from
the dark ages of 2009 into the modern era. He defined the workflow of
the 2010s.

12. The Evangelist: James Kyle

Handle: @thejameskyle
The Crown Jewel: flow / Babel Plugins
The Numbers: 625 Million+ downloads.
The Story: James was the bridge between complex compilers and
regular humans. He wrote the manuals, the guides, and the plugins that
made tools like Babel and Flow accessible.
Why it’s special: He turned &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; technology into
&ldquo;easy-to-use&rdquo; tools.

13. The Unicode Guardian: Mathias Bynens

Handle: @mathias
The Crown Jewel: he (HTML Entities)
The Numbers: 481 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Computers are bad at text, especially emojis and
weird symbols. Mathias is the world expert on how JavaScript handles
characters.
Why it’s special: If you have ever used an emoji 🚀 in a
password or a username and the site didn&rsquo;t crash, thank Mathias. He
ensures the web speaks every human language correctly.

14. The Godfather: TJ Holowaychuk

Handle: @tjholowaychuk
The Crown Jewel:
commander / mocha
The Numbers: 364 Million+ downloads.
The Story: The most prolific programmer in Node history. He
wrote the original versions of Express, Mocha, and Commander.
Why it’s special: He defined the &ldquo;style&rdquo; of Node.js. If you
write code that looks clean and elegant, you are likely mimicking TJ’s
style.

15. The Philosopher: James Halliday

Handle: @substack
The Crown Jewel:

leads directly to the modern tools we use today.

16. The Performance Obsessive: John-David Dalton

Handle: @jdalton
The Crown Jewel: lodash
The Numbers: 375 Million+ downloads.
The Story: JD Dalton realized the standard JavaScript library
was too slow and incomplete. He built Lodash, a utility belt that
became the most depended-upon library in history.
Why it’s special: He was obsessed with speed. His functions
were often faster than the browser&rsquo;s built-in ones.

17. The Command Line Commander: Ben Coe

Handle: @bcoe
The Crown Jewel: yargs
The Numbers: 310 Million+ downloads.
The Story: Ben makes the command line friendly. He maintains
Yargs, the tool that parses command line arguments.
Why it’s special: Every time you type a command like --help
or --version, Ben’s code figures out what you mean and tells the
program what to do.

18. The Polyfill King: Jordan Harband

Handle: @ljharb
The Crown Jewel:
object.assign
The Numbers: 279 Million+ downloads.

These are the \u0026ldquo;Invisible Giants.\u0026rdquo; You likely use their code every single day without realizing it.\nHere is the story of the top 21, starting with the master of the file system.\n1. The Watchman: Paul Millr Handle: @paulmillr The Crown Jewel: chokidar The Numbers: Used in over 30 million repositories; hundreds of millions of downloads. The Story: In the early days of Node.js, the simple act of \u0026ldquo;watching\u0026rdquo; a file for changes (so your app could reload automatically) was broken. It was buggy, crashed on Macs, and ignored errors on Windows. Paul didn\u0026rsquo;t just accept this; he built Chokidar. Why it’s special: It solved the most painful part of the developer experience: waiting. Every time you hit Ctrl+S in VS Code, or your React app instantly updates in the browser, that is Paul’s code running in the background, efficiently watching the world for you. 2. The King of Productivity: Sindre Sorhus Handle: @sindresorhus The Crown Jewel: chalk The Numbers: 1.9 Billion+ downloads. The Story: Sindre is a legend who believes in the \u0026ldquo;Unix Philosophy\u0026rdquo;: small modules that do one thing well. His most famous creation, Chalk, brought color to the terminal. Why it’s special: Before Sindre, the terminal was a bleak, black-and-white wall of text. He made errors red, warnings yellow, and success green. He literally colored the developer\u0026rsquo;s world, reducing eye strain and confusion for millions. 3. The Master of Micro-Utils: Jon Schlinkert Handle: @jonschlinkert The Crown Jewel: micromatch The Numbers: 1.3 Billion+ downloads. The Story: Jon is the master of \u0026ldquo;matching.\u0026rdquo; If you have ever typed *.js to find all JavaScript files, or src/**/*.css to find styles, you are using Jon\u0026rsquo;s logic. Why it’s special: His code is the invisible sorting machine inside Webpack, Babel, and ESLint. He ensures that when you ask for a file, the computer actually finds the right one. 4. The Partner in Code: Brian Woodward Handle: @doowb The Crown Jewel: handlebars-helpers The Numbers: 860 Million+ downloads. The Story: Often working in tandem with Jon Schlinkert, Brian builds the glue that holds static sites together. Why it’s special: He provides the \u0026ldquo;helpers\u0026rdquo; that allow templating engines to function—formatting dates, looping through data, and automating repetitive HTML tasks. He is the reason your blog generator works. 5. The Modernizer: Daniel Tschinder Handle: @danez The Crown Jewel: babel-plugin-transform... The Numbers: 774 Million+ downloads. The Story: Daniel is a core pillar of the Babel team. Babel is the \u0026ldquo;time machine\u0026rdquo; of the web; it lets you write futuristic code today and converts it into code that older browsers can understand. Why it’s special: Without Daniel, we would still be writing archaic JavaScript (ES5). He allows the entire industry to move forward without leaving users on older computers behind. 6. The Babel Keeper: Henry Zhu Handle: @hzoo The Crown Jewel: babel-core The Numbers: 743 Million+ downloads. The Story: Henry is the face of open-source sustainability. As the lead maintainer of Babel, he manages the compiler that powers React, Vue, and Next.js. Why it’s special: He holds the keys to the kingdom. If Babel breaks, the modern web breaks. His \u0026ldquo;package\u0026rdquo; is actually the peace of mind that your code will run anywhere, on any device. 7. The Architect: Logan Smyth Handle: @loganfsmyth The Crown Jewel: babel-loader The Numbers: 739 Million+ downloads. The Story: Logan builds the bridges. He specializes in how Babel talks to other tools, specifically Webpack. Why it’s special: He created the translation layer that connects your build system to the compiler. He makes sure the complex \u0026ldquo;pipeline\u0026rdquo; of modern web development flows smoothly without clogging. 8. The Father of NPM: Isaac Z. Schlueter Handle: @isaacs The Crown Jewel: glob (and created npm) The Numbers: 736 Million+ downloads. The Story: Isaac is royalty. He created npm itself. However, his most downloaded package is glob, which teaches Node.js how to find files on a hard drive using patterns. Why it’s special: He didn\u0026rsquo;t just write a package; he built the playground everyone else on this list is playing in. Every time you run npm install, you are using his invention. 9. The AST Surgeon: Brian Ng Handle: @existentialism The Crown Jewel: babel-types The Numbers: 685 Million+ downloads. The Story: Brian’s work allows software to \u0026ldquo;understand\u0026rdquo; other software. He maintains the tools that dissect code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Why it’s special: His tools don\u0026rsquo;t just read code; they surgically alter it. This is what allows tools to automatically fix your bugs or format your messy code. 10. The Server Savior: Doug Wilson Handle: @dougwilson The Crown Jewel: express The Numbers: 668 Million+ downloads. The Story: If you have ever visited a website powered by Node.js, it was likely running on Express. Doug has been the tireless maintainer of the standard web framework for Node. Why it’s special: He keeps the internet running. From small blogs to massive APIs, his code handles the request and sends the response. 11. The Creator: Sebastian McKenzie Handle: @sebmck The Crown Jewel: yarn (and created Babel) The Numbers: 632 Million+ downloads. The Story: Sebastian is a prodigy. He created Babel (originally 6to5) as a teenager and then created Yarn, a faster alternative to npm. Why it’s special: He single-handedly dragged JavaScript from the dark ages of 2009 into the modern era. He defined the workflow of the 2010s. 12. The Evangelist: James Kyle Handle: @thejameskyle The Crown Jewel: flow / Babel Plugins The Numbers: 625 Million+ downloads. The Story: James was the bridge between complex compilers and regular humans. He wrote the manuals, the guides, and the plugins that made tools like Babel and Flow accessible. Why it’s special: He turned \u0026ldquo;impossible\u0026rdquo; technology into \u0026ldquo;easy-to-use\u0026rdquo; tools. 13. The Unicode Guardian: Mathias Bynens Handle: @mathias The Crown Jewel: he (HTML Entities) The Numbers: 481 Million+ downloads. The Story: Computers are bad at text, especially emojis and weird symbols. Mathias is the world expert on how JavaScript handles characters. Why it’s special: If you have ever used an emoji 🚀 in a password or a username and the site didn\u0026rsquo;t crash, thank Mathias. He ensures the web speaks every human language correctly. 14. The Godfather: TJ Holowaychuk Handle: @tjholowaychuk The Crown Jewel: commander / mocha The Numbers: 364 Million+ downloads. The Story: The most prolific programmer in Node history. He wrote the original versions of Express, Mocha, and Commander. Why it’s special: He defined the \u0026ldquo;style\u0026rdquo; of Node.js.

internet is actually built on a foundation of open-source code
maintained by a small group of volunteers. These are the &ldquo;Invisible
Giants.&rdquo; You likely use their code every single day without realizing
it.</p><p>Here is the story of the top 21, starting with the master of the file system.</p><h3 id=1-the-watchman-paul-millr>1. The Watchman: Paul Millr<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-the-watchman-paul-millr>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Handle:</strong> <a href=https://github.com/paulmillr><code>@paulmillr</code></a></li><li><strong>The Crown Jewel:</strong> <strong><a href=https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar><code>chokidar</code></a></strong></li><li><strong>The Numbers:</strong> Used in over <strong>30 million</strong> repositories; hundreds
of millions of downloads.</li><li><strong>The Story:</strong> In the early days of Node.js, the simple act of
&ldquo;watching&rdquo; a file for changes (so your app could reload automatically)
was broken. It was buggy, crashed on Macs, and ignored errors on
Windows. Paul didn&rsquo;t just accept this; he built <strong>Chokidar</strong>.
<strong>Why it’s special:</strong> It solved the most painful part of the
developer experience: waiting. Every time you hit <code>Ctrl+S</code> in VS Code,
or your React app instantly updates in the browser, that is Paul’s
code running in the background, efficiently watching the world for
you.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=2-the-king-of-productivity-sindre-sorhus>2.

Philosophy&rdquo;: small modules that do one thing well. His most famous
creation, <strong>Chalk</strong>, brought color to the terminal.
<strong>Why it’s special:</strong> Before Sindre, the terminal was a bleak,
black-and-white wall of text. He made errors red, warnings yellow, and
success green. He literally colored the developer&rsquo;s world, reducing
eye strain and confusion for millions.</li></ul><h3 id=3-the-master-of-micro-utils-jon-schlinkert>3.

<strong><a href=https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch><code>micromatch</code></a></strong></li><li><strong>The Numbers:</strong> 1.3 Billion+ downloads.</li><li><strong>The Story:</strong> Jon is the master of &ldquo;matching.&rdquo; If you have ever
typed <code>*.js</code> to find all JavaScript files, or <code>src/**/*.css</code> to find
styles, you are using Jon&rsquo;s logic.
<strong>Why it’s special:</strong> His code is the invisible sorting machine
inside Webpack, Babel, and ESLint. He ensures that when you ask for a
file, the computer actually finds the right one.</li></ul><h3 id=4-the-partner-in-code-brian-woodward>4.
