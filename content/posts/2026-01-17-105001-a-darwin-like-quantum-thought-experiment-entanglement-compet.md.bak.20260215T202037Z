A readable reconstruction of the full chain of questions about Darwin-like behavior in quantum physics: what entanglement really implies (and what it can’t do), why measurement and decoherence feel like ‘selection,’ what degrees of freedom can be entangled, where nuclear spin fits, and the cleanest experiment-style test for a Darwin-like mechanism (Quantum Darwinism).<br><br>## 0) The full thought process (your idea, stated clearly and in order)<br><br>You were building a single “Darwin-like” picture of quantum physics:<br><br>1) **Entanglement looks like a connection across distance.**  <br>   If systems **A** and **B** are entangled, then “when A changes, B updates” (even far away).<br><br>2) **If B updates, B should affect its surroundings.**  <br>   In real physics, properties like **spin, polarization, frequency/energy, etc.** can change how something interacts with what’s around it.  <br>   So you asked: *if entanglement updates B, shouldn’t B’s environment respond?*<br><br>3) **But everyone says entanglement can’t transmit influence or information. Why?**  <br>   You suspected the “limits might be wrong,” because the update feels real.<br><br>4) **How do we even prove entanglement?**  <br>   Do we need to measure both sides “at the same time”?  <br>   Do we need to change both A and B together to keep them entangled?  <br>   Or can we operate on one side only?<br><br>5) **Is entanglement only about spin / 0-and-1?**  <br>   Or are there other entangled properties, maybe “more physical,” that could influence surroundings differently?<br><br>6) **Quantum computing is hard because observation changes the state and errors are everywhere.**  <br>   You asked whether this resembles **competition between states** (many possibilities “fight,” one persists), which sounds Darwin-like.<br><br>7) **What about nuclear physics (fusion/fission)?**  <br>   Spin matters in nuclear reaction channels.  <br>   Could changing spin “mid-process” produce different reaction paths?  <br>   Could entanglement + nuclear reactions create a Darwin-like selection mechanism?<br><br>8) **If we zoom out to the whole universe (black holes, expansion, creation of matter):**  <br>   could deep entanglement networks create “chaos somewhere else,” analogous to Darwinian influence in physics?<br><br>9) **Bottom line request:**  <br>   *What is the closest experiment (and thought experiment) where quantum physics truly behaves “Darwin-like,” and what would count as proof?*<br><br>This post answers *all of those* while keeping the “Darwin” intuition intact—but separating correlation from causation.<br><br>---<br><br>## 1) The central correction: entanglement is **correlation**, not a **remote control wire**<br><br>### 1.1 What entanglement really gives you<br>Entanglement gives you **strong correlations** between outcomes when A and B are measured and later compared.<br><br>A simple mental model:<br>- If A and B are entangled and you measure the “same kind of thing” on both sides, you can get results like **up–down, up–down** (or **up–up, down–down**) in a very strict pattern—stronger than any classical “shared random seed” can reproduce.<br><br>### 1.2 What entanglement does *not* give you<br>Entanglement does **not** let you do this:<br><br>&gt; “I choose an action on A, and that forces a detectable local change in B (and therefore in B’s environment), without sending any normal signal.”<br><br>This is the **no-signaling / no-communication** constraint: local actions on A cannot be used to transmit controllable information to B.  <br>A clean reference statement: the *no-communication theorem* (often presented as the no-signaling principle).  <br>See overview: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem</a><br><br>### 1.3 Why your “B must influence its environment” step doesn’t follow<br>You were reasoning:<br><br>- If A “updates” B, and<br>- B is sitting in an environment,<br>- then the environment should react differently.<br><br>The subtle point is that the “update” you get from entanglement is mainly a **relationship update** (correlations) that becomes usable **only once outcomes are compared**.  <br>Locally, B still looks statistically the same *until* B receives ordinary information from A (light-speed classical communication).<br><br>**Important:**<br>- The update is *real* in the joint statistics.<br>- But it does not become a controllable, local “push” at B.<br><br>---<br><br>## 2) “But mathematically we know B changed”—what that means (without heavy math)<br><br>You said: even if we don’t measure, we can “mathematically know” the joint state changed, so B “is changing.”<br><br>Here is the clean version that preserves your thought but fixes the inference:<br><br>- Quantum theory lets you describe the **global A–B state** and the **local B-only description**.<br>- Acting on A can change the **global correlations**.<br>- But B’s **local description** (the part that determines how B interacts with nearby stuff) does not become controllably different just because you did something at A.<br><br>So the statement “B changed” can be true in the sense of *global correlation structure*, while still being false in the sense of *local detectable behavior at B*.<br><br>---<br><br>## 3) The “technical term you forgot”: entanglement (and why people also mention steering)<br><br>When you described “two distant systems where a change here changes what we can say about the other side,” the main term is:<br><br>- **Entanglement** (shared nonclassical correlations).<br><br>A related term that sometimes matches people’s intuition is:<br><br>- **Quantum steering**: by choosing what you measure on A, you can “steer” the *conditional ensemble* you would assign to B.  <br>  But crucially, B still cannot tell which ensemble it is in without classical information from A—so no remote control is created.<br><br>(For your purposes: entanglement is the essential term; steering is a refinement.)<br><br>---<br><br>## 4) How we *prove* entanglement (and whether we must “change both sides at the same time”)<br><br>### 4.1 What counts as proof in the lab<br>Operationally, the gold standard is:<br>- measure A and B in multiple settings,<br>- show correlations violate a **Bell inequality** (often CHSH).<br><br>A canonical “loophole-free” Bell test:  <br>Hensen et al. (2015, *Nature*): <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15759">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15759</a><br><br>### 4.2 Do we need to measure at the same time?<br>Not “same time” in the everyday sense, but in the cleanest Bell tests you arrange:<br>- the setting choices are independent and made late,<br>- and the measurement events are spacelike separated,<br>so ordinary signals cannot coordinate the results.<br><br>That eliminates classical coordination as an explanation for the observed correlation strength.<br><br>### 4.3 Do we need to operate on both sides to keep entanglement?<br>No.<br>- You can do many operations on **one side** (unitaries/rotations) and keep entanglement.<br>- A **measurement** on one side typically turns entanglement into a classical correlation (because measurement creates a definite outcome record).<br><br>So you *can* act on one side—but you cannot use that to impose a controllable, locally detectable change at the other side.<br><br>---<br><br>## 5) Is entanglement only spin / “0 and 1”?<br><br>No. Spin is just the easiest story.<br><br>You can entangle many kinds of degrees of freedom:<br>- photon polarization,<br>- path (which route),<br>- time-bin (early/late),<br>- frequency/energy,<br>- orbital angular momentum,<br>- vibrational/collective modes, etc.<br><br>Also, systems need not be restricted to two levels:<br>- **qubits** are 2-level because they are convenient,<br>- but **qudits** (d-level) and continuous-variable entanglement exist.<br><br>**Key point for your argument:**  <br>Different degrees of freedom can influence their local surroundings in different ways—**but none of them let A remotely control B’s local statistics** (no-signaling still holds).<br><br>---<br><br>## 6) Why quantum computing “feels Darwinian” (and what part of that is real)<br><br>You connected two facts:<br>- In quantum computing, **observation changes the state**.<br>- Decoherence and noise create errors; keeping superpositions is hard.<br><br>This does resemble a kind of “selection”:<br>- many quantum possibilities exist,<br>- the environment tends to destroy delicate superpositions,<br>- stable patterns survive longer.<br><br>But this is not biological Darwinism:<br>- there is no open-ended adaptation,<br>- no evolving population of templates,<br>- and no accumulating design.<br><br>Still, your intuition is pointing to the right physics: **environmental monitoring filters states.**<br><br>And that leads directly to the main Darwin-like framework in quantum foundations:<br><br>&gt; **Quantum Darwinism.**<br><br>---<br><br>## 7) The Darwin-like mechanism in quantum foundations: Quantum Darwinism (selection + replication of records)<br><br>### 7.1 The core idea (plain language)<br>Quantum Darwinism (Zurek and collaborators) says the environment does two linked things:<br><br>1) **Selection (einselection):**  <br>   Interaction with the environment picks out “pointer states” that are robust (they persist under monitoring).<br><br>2) **Replication (redundant records):**  <br>   Information about those pointer states gets copied into **many independent fragments** of the environment—so many observers can each read a different fragment and still agree on the same “classical fact.”<br><br>Foundational reference:  <br>Zurek (2009) “Quantum Darwinism”: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5082">https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5082</a><br><br>Intuitive “everyday environment” model: scattered photons create huge redundancy:  <br>Riedel &amp; Zurek (2010, PRL): <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.020404">https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.020404</a><br><br>Operational redundancy definition/analysis:  <br>Zwolak &amp; Zurek (2017, PRA): <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.030101">https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.030101</a><br><br>### 7.2 Why this matches your Darwin analogy better than entanglement alone<br>Your Darwin mapping becomes:<br><br>- “Variants” = quantum alternatives in a superposition.<br>- “Selection pressure” = decoherence/monitoring by the environment.<br>- “Survivors” = pointer states (stable under that pressure).<br>- “Replication” = many environment fragments record the same pointer information.<br><br>This is *exactly* the Darwin-like story you were searching for: not remote causal influence, but **local selection + copying of information into surroundings.**<br><br>---<br><br>## 8) The Darwin-like *thought experiment* that matches every piece of your proposal<br><br>You asked for:<br>- entanglement,<br>- two distant systems,<br>- each embedded in surroundings,<br>- where the surroundings show a Darwin-like “reaction,”<br>- and a clear way to test/verify it.<br><br>Here is the cleanest version that preserves your intent while respecting no-signaling:<br><br>### “Two-Wing Quantum Darwinism” Thought Experiment<br><br>**Step A — Start with entanglement**<br>- Prepare two systems, **A** and **B**, in an entangled state.<br><br>**Step B — Give each system its own environment**<br>- A interacts locally with environment **E_A**, made of many fragments (many ancilla qubits, many photon modes, etc.).<br>- B interacts locally with environment **E_B**, also made of many fragments.<br>- No cross-talk between the wings: only A↔E_A and B↔E_B.<br><br>**Step C — Let the environments ‘monitor’ a preferred property**<br>- The interaction is such that it “measures” (monitors) a particular property (the pointer property) on each side.<br>- This suppresses fragile superpositions (selection).<br><br>**Step D — Record proliferation**<br>- The pointer outcome gets copied into many fragments of each environment.<br>- Many independent observers can sample different fragments and reach the same conclusion (replication + objectivity).<br><br>**What you have achieved**<br>- You used entanglement (your “connection” idea),<br>- but the Darwin-like part happens locally:<br>  - environments select and<br>  - environments replicate records.<br><br>**What you do *not* get (and why)**<br>- You do not get “A causes B’s environment to react differently,” because that would be remote control and would violate no-signaling.<br><br>Instead, you get something subtler and closer to your “Darwin” picture:<br>- *quantum correlations exist globally,* but<br>- *classical reality emerges locally via selection + redundant copying into surroundings.*<br><br>---<br><br>## 9) What would count as proof? (the experiment-style signature)<br><br>You asked specifically for “experiment chance to prove it.”<br><br>Quantum Darwinism is not “just decoherence.” The key observable claim is:<br><br>&gt; **Redundant records exist: many different fragments of the environment each independently carry (nearly) the same classical information about the system’s pointer state.**<br><br>### The simplest “proof pattern” (no heavy math)<br>Do many runs. Each run:<br>- prepare the system,<br>- let it interact with its environment,<br>- then measure only a *small* subset of environment fragments.<br><br>If small subsets already reveal the pointer outcome reliably, and *many different subsets* do so independently, that means the environment contains **multiple copies** (redundancy).<br><br>In papers this is quantified by plots of “how much information you gain” vs “how large a fraction of the environment you capture,” showing a fast rise and a wide plateau (the redundancy plateau).  <br>Riedel &amp; Zurek (2010) and Zwolak &amp; Zurek (2017) discuss this kind of signature.  <br>- <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.020404">https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.020404</a>  <br>- <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.030101">https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.030101</a><br><br>### The selection control test<br>Repeat the same redundancy check for a different, incompatible property.  <br>Prediction: redundancy is strong for the pointer information and weak for incompatible observables (because the environment “selects” which information survives and gets copied).<br><br>---<br><br>## 10) A realistic modern experimental anchor (what has been done already)<br><br>A recent experiment reports a comprehensive observation of Quantum Darwinism signatures using superconducting circuits:<br><br>Zhu et al. (2025) “Observation of quantum Darwinism and the origin of classicality with superconducting circuits” (*Science Advances*):  <br>- <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx6857">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx6857</a>  <br>Open access (PMC): <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12315987/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12315987/</a><br><br>This matters for your “chance to prove it” question:<br>- It shows the redundancy/record-proliferation program is experimentally viable in engineered platforms.<br>- Your two-wing extension (start with A–B entanglement, then let each wing undergo local record proliferation and track how correlations become objective records) is conceptually straightforward, but technically heavier (more qubits/modes, more calibration, more measurements).<br><br>---<br><br>## 11) Where nuclear fusion/fission and spin fit into *your* Darwin-like story<br><br>You asked whether spin “really matters” physically (e.g., in fusion/fission), and whether entanglement + spin could change reaction “paths.”<br><br>### 11.1 Spin matters locally in nuclear reaction probabilities<br>Yes—spin alignment can change which reaction channels are favored.<br><br>A concrete example you cited in spirit: **spin-polarized D–T fuel**.  <br>Reviews and calculations note that aligning D and T spins can increase the D–T fusion cross section by about a factor **1.5** (≈50%) under ideal polarization assumptions.  <br>- Heidbrink et al.
