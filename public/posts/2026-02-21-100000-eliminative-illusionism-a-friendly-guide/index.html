It says: maybe what we call “raw inner feel” (qualia) is not what we think it is. Maybe the mind builds a convincing story about experience, and we confuse that story for a mysterious extra substance.\nThat sounds extreme at first. But this view exists for a reason: many philosophers and scientists think traditional ideas about consciousness are too vague, too magical, or impossible to connect to brain science.\nThis post explains the main voices in this column in simple language — what each person is trying to do, what they get right, and what critics push back on.\nQuick orientation: eliminativism vs illusionism Before the names, the key split:\nEliminativism: some everyday mental concepts (like folk ideas of “belief,” “qualia,” or “inner glow”) may be scientifically wrong and should be replaced. Illusionism: conscious experience exists, but our introspection about its nature is misleading. The illusion is not that experience exists, but that it has the weird, irreducible properties we attribute to it. So these views are not saying “nothing is happening.” They are saying “something is happening, but our self-explanation is distorted.”\nChurchlands (Patricia and Paul Churchland) The Churchlands are central eliminativists. Their core claim is that “folk psychology” (our everyday way of talking about mind) may end up like outdated pre-scientific theories.\nSimple version:\nPeople once explained disease with “bad humors.” Modern biology replaced that model. Likewise, future neuroscience may replace many common-sense mental categories. Why this matters:\nThey forced philosophers to treat neuroscience as a possible revision of mental concepts, not just an add-on.\nMain criticism:\nFolk psychology, unlike humors, still works surprisingly well in everyday prediction. So maybe it is rough but not totally false.\nDennett Daniel Dennett is often read as the bridge from strict eliminativism to sophisticated illusionism-like approaches.\nHis move:\nReject the idea of a “Cartesian theater” (a little inner screen where experience is presented). Treat consciousness as distributed, dynamic, and functionally explainable. Explain the sense of immediacy and inner certainty without adding non-physical essence. Dennett’s strength is explanatory engineering: he asks how the brain could create the user-level appearance of rich inner life.\nCritics say he explains access and behavior better than the “felt feel.” Supporters answer: that demand may itself be a conceptual trap.\nFrankish Keith Frankish is one of the clearest modern defenders of illusionism.\nHis key line:\nWe should be realists about mental states and reports. But anti-realists about qualia as non-physical, intrinsic mental paint. In plain language: your pain is real, your suffering is real, your report is real — but the theory that pain has a spooky extra property may be wrong.\nFrankish is useful because he states the position without sarcasm or reductionist machismo; he treats it as a serious research program.\nHumphrey Nicholas Humphrey emphasizes the evolutionary and experiential framing of consciousness. Even when he differs in tone from strict eliminativists, he contributes a key idea:\nConsciousness may be a biologically useful self-model that shapes motivation, social life, and meaning. In this column, Humphrey helps show that “constructed” does not mean “fake.” A rainbow is constructed by physics and perception, but still real as a phenomenon.\nGraziano Michael Graziano’s Attention Schema Theory (AST) is one of the strongest scientific allies of illusionist-friendly thinking.\nCore idea:\nThe brain builds a simplified model of its own attention (an “attention schema”). That model underlies the belief that we have private, ineffable awareness. Why powerful:\nIt gives a concrete mechanism for why people report consciousness the way they do.\nCritique:\nIt may explain reports about awareness, but critics ask whether it explains phenomenal character itself or sidesteps it.\nBlackmore Susan Blackmore challenges “inner self” intuitions and fixed observer models. Her broader work (including meme theory and no-self lines) supports this column’s anti-essential stance:\nWhat feels like a stable inner entity may be a process, not a thing. She is valuable because she connects philosophical skepticism about qualia with practical, psychological, and contemplative perspectives.\nKammerer François Kammerer is an important contemporary critic/analyst in this space, especially around illusionism’s strengths and limits.\nHis role in the map is crucial:\nHe pressure-tests whether illusionism actually dissolves the hard problem or just reframes it. He helps sharpen definitions so the debate is not pure wordplay. Think of him as quality control for the whole position.\nMandik Pete Mandik’s work in representational and naturalistic philosophy of mind contributes to the same broader project:\nexplain conscious-seeming phenomena through cognitive/representational architecture, avoid mystery inflation, keep continuity with neuroscience. Mandik-type approaches matter because they translate metaphysical claims into modelable cognitive terms.\nIrvine Elizabeth Irvine has worked on introspection, self-knowledge, and limits of first-person certainty. In this column, that matters a lot:\nIf introspection is less transparent than we assume, illusionist strategies become more plausible. Her contribution is epistemic humility: feeling sure about our own minds does not guarantee theoretical accuracy.\nOstendorf In the context of your list, Ostendorf functions as part of the contemporary comparative dialogue around anti-essential and model-based views of consciousness.\nPractical takeaway:\nKeep the debate empirical where possible, keep concepts precise, and avoid turning introspective language into untouchable metaphysics. Strongest argument for this column The strongest pro-illusionism point is this:\nWe already know the brain builds useful but simplified self-models in many domains. Why assume consciousness introspection is the one domain that is perfectly literal and complete?\nThis is a serious challenge to intuition-based anti-physicalism.\nStrongest argument against this column The strongest anti-illusionism point is this:\nEven if introspection is imperfect, that does not erase the datum that there is something it is like to be conscious. A theory that treats this as mere confusion risks explaining away what most needs explanation.\nThat is why this debate stays alive.\nPlain-language conclusion Eliminative illusionism is not “consciousness is fake.” It is “our usual theory of consciousness might be wrong in deep ways.”\nWhether you accept it or not, this column is valuable because it forces better questions:\nWhich parts of conscious experience are data? Which parts are interpretation? Which parts are narrative generated by the brain? If your goal is clarity, this school is impossible to ignore.\n","wordCount":"1024","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-20T22:50:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-20T22:50:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/2026-02-21-100000-eliminative-illusionism-a-friendly-guide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
