The Nostr private key is stored in secure storage and can be wiped on factory reset.\nDerivation: HKDF-SHA256 over sha256(btcKey) with a constant salt/info, then validation retry loop; implemented in lib/nostr/nostr.ts. Storage: Nostr key is stored in Keychain with biometrics, via lib/secureKeyStorage.ts (NOSTR_KEY_ID). Determinism: same Bitcoin key -\u003e same Nostr npub; factory reset wipes local key, so a new wallet key yields a new npub. The app exposes your npub suffix in the input row (tap to copy full npub) in components/NostrChatModal.tsx. End‑to‑End Encryption (NIP‑17 + NIP‑44) We use NIP‑17 “gift wrap” with NIP‑44 v2 encryption (XChaCha20‑Poly1305). Relays only see encrypted blobs; only the recipient’s private key can decrypt.\nEncryption flow is implemented in lib/nostr/nostr.ts:\nCreate a “rumor” (kind 14) with the plaintext message and sender pubkey. Encrypt the rumor to the recipient using a random “seal” key (NIP‑44), sign it as kind 13. Encrypt the seal to the recipient using a random “wrap” key (NIP‑44), sign it as kind 1059 (gift wrap), tag [“p”, recipientPubkey]. The outer gift‑wrap (kind 1059) is published to relays; only the recipient can decrypt it. NIP‑44 details (also in lib/crypto.ts):\nECDH shared secret is computed from secp256k1 keys. We derive the NIP‑44 key as HKDF(SHA256(x-only-shared-secret), info=“nip44-v2”). Payload encryption is XChaCha20‑Poly1305 with a 24‑byte random nonce. Important security note Right now the sender’s long‑term secret is not used to sign the rumor. That means the content is confidential (E2E), but sender identity is not cryptographically authenticated — any sender could spoof the pubkey inside the rumor. If you want authenticated sender identity, we should sign the rumor (or switch to a NIP‑44 DM flow that includes authentication). This is the one notable integrity gap today in lib/nostr/nostr.ts.\nSend Path (Client -\u003e Relay) Handled in components/NostrChatModal.tsx.\nValidate recipient pubkey; block self‑chat. Create gift wrap with createNip17GiftWrap, then send [“EVENT”, giftwrap] over all open relay WebSockets. Log: sender, recipient, event id, message length, and relay acknowledgements. UI immediately appends the outgoing message to local state. Receive Path (Relay -\u003e Client) Also in components/NostrChatModal.tsx.\nSubscribe to kind 1059 with a #p tag equal to our pubkey. Deduplicate by event id and decrypt via openNip17GiftWrap. Extract rumor content + sender pubkey, then display as an incoming message. Auto‑add sender to local contacts. Catch‑Up Behavior (Missed Messages) We added a light “catch‑up” flow that pulls missed messages after reconnect.\nWe store a last_seen timestamp per pubkey in Keychain using NOSTR_LAST_SEEN_CACHE_KEY in lib/nostr/storage.ts. On each relay subscription, we add since = last_seen - 60s to the filter to backfill recent messages. This is implemented in components/NostrChatModal.tsx, and the cache is wiped on factory reset in services/factoryReset.ts. Relay Connectivity We use a small set of public relays by default (no infra needed right now).\nDefault relays: wss://relay.damus.io, wss://relay.primal.net, wss://nostr21.com. WebSocket connections are created while the chat modal is open and closed when it closes. If the app is closed/offline, real‑time delivery pauses; catch‑up works if the relays still have the message. Chat UX + Contact List The UI is minimal and built to fit the app’s design language.\nChat list shows: Private Support, Group Support (disabled), and dynamic contacts; last message + date/time appear in subtitle. Active chat title is last 5 chars of recipient npub, with a copy icon. Back link is text (“\u003c back”) and underlined for clarity. Composer is one‑line input with a send icon inside; send can also use keyboard “Send”. “You” label removed; only your own suffix is shown and tappable to copy. All of this lives in components/NostrChatModal.tsx.\nSupport Logic Support is hard‑coded and shown to all non‑support users.\nSupport npub configured in screens/BitcoinDebugModal.tsx. If the user’s npub matches support, the support chat is hidden and self‑chat is blocked. Storage \u0026 Reset We persist only what we need.\nContacts cache: @cache:nostr_contacts in Keychain. Last‑seen cache: @cache:nostr_last_seen in Keychain. Messages are in memory only; they do not persist across modal closes or app restarts. Factory reset clears all of the above + Nostr private key (see services/factoryReset.ts). What “End‑to‑End Encrypted” Means Here\nConfidentiality: Relays never see plaintext; only the recipient with the private key can decrypt. Forward secrecy: Each message uses fresh seal/wrap keys. Authentication: Not yet guaranteed — sender identity can be spoofed because the rumor isn’t signed. Operational Notes\nNo infra required today. If you want stronger reliability, run your own relay and add it to the list. No push notifications; catch‑up works when the chat opens. Delivery depends on relay retention; some relays drop DMs. If you want me to add sender authentication (signed rumor) or background delivery, I can outline the minimal changes.\nPost created via email from emin@nuri.com\n","wordCount":"839","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-15T19:40:01Z","dateModified":"2026-01-15T19:40:01Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/what-we-built-nostr-dm-in-nuri/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
