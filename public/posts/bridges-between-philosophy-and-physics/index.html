They’re like two people talking about the same universe in different styles.\nBelow is a way you could explain it to your girlfriend, with names and examples you can drop in.\nWhat each one does (in simple words) Philosophy asks:\nWhat is time, really? What is space? What is cause and effect? Is the universe infinite? Why is there something instead of nothing?\nIt uses thinking, arguments, and logic, not experiments.\nPhysics/astrophysics asks:\nHow fast does time pass near a black hole? What is the exact shape of space? What is the universe made of (atoms, particles, dark matter, etc.)? How did the universe begin and how will it end?\nIt uses math, experiments, telescopes and tests ideas against data.\nBridge:\nPhilosophy often creates the questions and concepts.\nPhysics then turns them into testable theories.\nThe Greeks: where it all started “What is the universe made of?”\nThales (ancient Greek): thought everything was made of water. Democritus: guessed that everything is made of tiny invisible pieces called atoms.\nNo microscopes, no experiments – just philosophical thinking. Today physics says: atoms, particles, quantum fields.\nDemocritus wasn’t “right” in detail, but the idea of tiny building blocks was a huge philosophical step that physics later made precise.\n“What is motion? Can things really move?”\nZeno of Elea made paradoxes:\nTo walk across a room, you must first go halfway, then half of the remaining distance, and so on forever. - So, how do you ever arrive? This is a philosophical problem about infinity and motion.\nBridge to physics:\nCenturies later, physics and math (calculus) showed how infinite sums can still give a finite distance and time, solving the paradox in a mathematical way.\nAristotle to Newton: from philosophy to “natural philosophy” For a long time, physics was called “natural philosophy”.\nAristotle thought the Earth is the center, and the heavens move in perfect circles.\nThis was a philosophical picture of a “perfect” universe.\nThen came:\nGalileo – used experiments (balls rolling down ramps) to study motion. Isaac Newton – wrote “Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy”.\nHe gave the laws of motion and gravity. - Space and time, in his view, were like a fixed stage on which everything happens, always the same everywhere. Philosophical questions raised by Newton:\nIs time flowing the same for everyone, everywhere? Are the laws of nature “out there” or just human descriptions? If the laws of physics determine everything, what about free will?\nThese are philosophical questions about physics.\nEinstein: when philosophy and physics hug each other Albert Einstein is a great example of the bridge.\nHe didn’t just crunch numbers; he did thought experiments:\nImagine riding on a beam of light. Imagine being in an elevator in space (weightless) vs in a gravitational field.\nThese are philosophical-style stories used to test ideas.\nSpace and time\nBefore Einstein:\nSpace = one thing Time = another thing Both absolute, same for everyone (Newton’s view).\nEinstein’s relativity:\nSpace and time are not separate; they form spacetime. Time runs differently depending on your speed and gravity. There is no single “universal now” for the whole universe.\nThis is a massive philosophical change in our picture of reality.\nEinstein was influenced by philosophical thinkers like Ernst Mach and read philosophers such as Hume and Kant. He cared a lot about:\nWhat is “real”? What does it mean to “measure” something?\nEinstein vs quantum physics\nQuantum physics says: on very small scales, outcomes are probabilistic (involving chance).\nEinstein hated this idea:\nHe said, “God does not play dice with the universe.” Niels Bohr (another physicist) basically answered: Stop telling God what to do.\nThis is a philosophical fight:\nIs the universe fundamentally random? Or are we just missing hidden rules?\nSo even inside physics, they were arguing about what reality is like.\nAstrophysics \u0026 cosmology: the biggest philosophical questions Astrophysics looks at stars, galaxies, black holes, the whole universe.\nCosmology asks questions that are deeply philosophical:\nDid the universe have a beginning? Is the universe finite or infinite? Will it end? How? Why do the laws of physics allow life to exist?\nStephen Hawking\nStephen Hawking worked on black holes and the Big Bang.\nHe asked questions like:\nWhat happened at the beginning of the universe? What happens inside a black hole? Do we need a “creator” once we have a full theory?\nBlack holes and information\nHawking discovered that black holes are not perfectly “black”; they can emit radiation (Hawking radiation) and can slowly evaporate.\nPhilosophical problem:\nIf something falls into a black hole and the black hole evaporates,\nIs the information destroyed? Quantum theory says: information should never be truly destroyed. So which is right?\nThis is a physics problem and also a philosophical puzzle about the nature of information and reality.\nBeginning of the universe\nHawking \u0026 Hartle proposed a model where the universe could be finite but without a sharp beginning, like the surface of a sphere has no edge.\nThat touches the philosophical question:\n“What was before the Big Bang?”\n– Maybe that’s the wrong question, if time itself begins there.\nFamous philosophers linked to physics You can mention a few names to show the overlap:\nPlato – believed in perfect mathematical forms; inspired the idea that the universe is deeply mathematical. Aristotle – early theories of motion, elements, cosmos. René Descartes – tried to explain the world as matter in motion, very “mechanical universe”. David Hume – questioned what “cause and effect” really mean. Influenced later philosophers and scientists. Immanuel Kant – argued that space and time are part of how our mind structures experience, not things we simply “see out there”. Karl Popper – said a good scientific theory must be falsifiable (you can test it and possibly prove it wrong). Huge influence on how physicists think about theories, including cosmology.\nAnd physicists who thought very philosophically:\nNewton – laws of motion and gravity, but also huge philosophical debates about space and time. Einstein – relativity, quantum debates, always worrying about what is real. Niels Bohr \u0026 Werner Heisenberg – developed quantum mechanics and spent tons of time on its philosophical meaning. Stephen Hawking – cosmology, black holes, and the meaning of “beginning” and “laws of nature”.\nHow you might explain it to her in one short speech You could say something like:\n“Philosophy and physics are like two ways of talking about the same universe.\nPhilosophers ask the big, general questions: What is time? What is space? Why does anything exist at all?\nPhysicists take some of those questions and turn them into testable theories with math and experiments.\nThe ancient Greeks like Democritus guessed there are tiny atoms – that was philosophy.\nModern physics and chemistry later showed atoms are real and studied them in detail.\nEinstein used very philosophical thought experiments about space and time and ended up with relativity, which tells us time runs differently near a black hole.\nStephen Hawking took philosophical questions about the beginning of the universe and black holes and turned them into concrete predictions, like Hawking radiation.\nSo philosophy and physics meet whenever we ask: What is the universe really like, deep down? Philosophy helps us form the ideas; physics helps us test which ideas actually match reality.”\nIf you want, I can help you turn this into a super short 1-minute explanation or a cute analogy you can tell her.\nPost created via email from emin@nuri.com\n","wordCount":"1327","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-06T09:20:01Z","dateModified":"2025-12-06T09:20:01Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/bridges-between-philosophy-and-physics/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

“mechanical universe”.</h2><h2 id=later-philosophers-and-scientists>David Hume – questioned what “cause and effect” really mean. Influenced
later philosophers and scientists.</h2><h2 id=structures-experience-not-things-we-simply-see-out-there>Immanuel Kant – argued that space and time are part of how our mind
structures experience, not things we simply “see out there”.</h2><p>Karl Popper – said a good scientific theory must be falsifiable (you can
test it and possibly prove it wrong). Huge influence on how physicists
think about theories, including cosmology.</p><p>And physicists who thought very philosophically:</p><ul><li></li></ul><h2 id=about-space-and-time>Newton – laws of motion and gravity, but also huge philosophical debates
about space and time.</h2><h2 id=real>Einstein – relativity, quantum debates, always worrying about what is
real.</h2><h2 id=tons-of-time-on-its-philosophical-meaning>Niels Bohr & Werner Heisenberg – developed quantum mechanics and spent
tons of time on its philosophical meaning.</h2><p>Stephen Hawking – cosmology, black holes, and the meaning of “beginning”
and “laws of nature”.</p><hr><ol start=7><li>How you might explain it to her in one short speech</li></ol><p>You could say something like:</p><p>“Philosophy and physics are like two ways of talking about the same
universe.</p><p>Philosophers ask the big, general questions: What is time? What is space?
Why does anything exist at all?</p><p>Physicists take some of those questions and turn them into testable
theories with math and experiments.</p><p>The ancient Greeks like Democritus guessed there are tiny atoms – that was
philosophy.</p><p>Modern physics and chemistry later showed atoms are real and studied them
in detail.</p><p>Einstein used very philosophical thought experiments about space and time
and ended up with relativity, which tells us time runs differently near a
black hole.</p><p>Stephen Hawking took philosophical questions about the beginning of the
universe and black holes and turned them into concrete predictions, like
Hawking radiation.</p><p>So philosophy and physics meet whenever we ask: What is the universe really
like, deep down? Philosophy helps us form the ideas; physics helps us test
which ideas actually match reality.”</p><p>If you want, I can help you turn this into a super short 1-minute
explanation or a cute analogy you can tell her.</p><hr><p><em>Post created via email from <a href=mailto:emin@nuri.com>emin@nuri.com</a></em></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://emino.app/tags/email-post/>Email-Post</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://emino.app/posts/building-a-cross-chain-btc-eure-market-maker-with-near-inten/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Building a Cross‑Chain BTC ↔ EURe Market Maker with NEAR Intents & 1‑Click</span>
