1. Project Inception and Vision (2016 – 2017)

Founding: ThreeFold was established in 2016 by a team of
internet veterans led by Kristof De Spiegeleer.
Core Philosophy: The mission was to create a &ldquo;People’s Internet&rdquo;
that is open-source, neutral, and highly secure.
Technical Development: The foundation for the network was the
development of Zero-OS, a lightweight operating system that
removes the need for human intervention in server management
(Self-Healing and Autonomous).

2. Infrastructure Evolution: The Grid Versions
The network has evolved through several iterations to scale its
capacity and transition toward a commercial marketplace."><meta name=author content="Emin Henri Mahrt"><link rel=canonical href=https://emino.app/posts/comprehensive-history-of-the-threefold-network-and-tokens/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://emino.app/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://emino.app/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://emino.app/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://emino.app/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://emino.app/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://emino.app/posts/comprehensive-history-of-the-threefold-network-and-tokens/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://emino.app/posts/comprehensive-history-of-the-threefold-network-and-tokens/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Emino.App's, Art's & Articles by Emin Mahrt"><meta property="og:title" content="Comprehensive History of the ThreeFold Network and Tokens"><meta property="og:description" content="The ThreeFold Network is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) internet infrastructure project.

Technical Development: The foundation for the network was the development of Zero-OS, a lightweight operating system that removes the need for human intervention in server management (Self-Healing and Autonomous). 2. Infrastructure Evolution: The Grid Versions The network has evolved through several iterations to scale its capacity and transition toward a commercial marketplace.\nGrid v1.0 \u0026 v2.0 (2018 – 2019): These early versions focused on testing the “Proof-of-Capacity” model, where users (Farmers) were rewarded for proving their hardware was connected to the grid. Grid v3.0 (2020 – 2025): This era saw the network expand to a global scale, utilizing the Stellar blockchain to manage capacity. At its peak, the grid reached over 80 million GB of capacity across thousands of nodes in more than 20 countries. Grid v4.0 (2026 – Future): Launched in early 2026, this version represents a shift to a “Utilization-based” economy. It introduces a marketplace where users rent “slices” of computing resources directly from Farmers, who set their own pricing. 3. The History of ThreeFold Tokens (TFT, SPORE, AUR) ThreeFold employs a multi-asset ecosystem to balance rewards for infrastructure providers with predictable pricing for end-users.\nThe ThreeFold Token (TFT) Launch: TFT was introduced as the primary utility token of the network. Minting Model: Unlike most cryptocurrencies, TFT was never sold in an ICO. It is only “minted” when a Farmer adds active hardware to the grid. Blockchain Rails: Originally built on the Stellar network, TFT later expanded via bridges to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and the native TF Chain (Substrate). Token Cap: The total supply is strictly capped at 4 billion tokens. The New v4 Economy: SPORE and AUR As of February 2026, the network is transitioning to a more commercial economic model.\nSPORE: The new primary utility and reward token for v4. It is used for paying for grid services and as the payout for Farmers. The network has provided a one-way bridge for users to convert their legacy TFT tokens into SPORE to join the v4 ecosystem. AUR: A gold-backed stablecoin introduced to provide price stability for corporate and enterprise users. This allows users to pay for computing “slices” without being exposed to the volatility of traditional crypto markets. 4. Key Milestones and Timeline 2016: Project founded; initial development of Zero-OS begins. 2018: Early Grid versions launch; first ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) are minted. 2020: Launch of Grid 3.0 on the Stellar blockchain. 2021: Major growth phase, surpassing 80 PB of storage capacity globally. 2024: The community votes to transition from a “Capacity-based” to a “Utilization-based” reward model. Feb 8, 2026: Official termination of minting rewards on the v3 grid; mandatory migration to the v4 marketplace begins. 2026+: Launch of the v4 Marketplace, AUR stablecoin, and options to convert rewards into BTC, ETH, and USDC.
