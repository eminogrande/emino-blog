In this intense discussion on *What Bitcoin Did*, Michael Saylor
reflects on the structural shifts for Bitcoin throughout 2025 and
early 2026. He addresses the "toxic" criticism surrounding Bitcoin
treasury companies and explains his vision for Bitcoin as the
foundation of a global digital credit system.

## 1. Bitcoin Fundamentals vs. Short-Term Price Action
Saylor argues that 2025 was a landmark year for Bitcoin’s structural
integrity, regardless of short-term price volatility. He notes that
the community often suffers from a "short memory," focusing on weekly
candles rather than generational wins.

* **Institutional Adoption:** The number of public companies holding
Bitcoin on their balance sheets surged from ~60 to over 200.
* **Regulatory Milestones:** The implementation of **fair value
accounting** and positive guidance on corporate taxes have removed the
primary "friction" for CFOs.
* **Banking Integration:** Major institutions like JP Morgan and
Morgan Stanley have pivoted from skepticism to extending credit
against Bitcoin ETFs.

## 2. The Fallacy of the 100-Day Perspective
Saylor dismisses concerns about Bitcoin’s price relative to its 90-day
high. He compares Bitcoin to revolutionary technologies like
**electricity** and **nuclear power**, which took decades to reach
mainstream utility.

> "Humanity spent 50 years being skeptical of nuclear energy before realizing its necessity for AI; Bitcoin's current skepticism is a rounding error in comparison."

## 3. Defending the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
The debate gets heated regarding smaller companies adopting the
"Bitcoin Treasury" model. Saylor defends these firms against critics
who label them "MicroStrategy clones":

* **Rational Capital Allocation:** For a struggling business, buying
Bitcoin is more rational than holding debasing fiat or buying back
stock in a declining industry.
* **Optionality:** Unlike an ETF, an operating company can use its
Bitcoin as collateral to underwrite insurance, issue credit, or pivot
business lines.
* **No Competition:** Saylor rejects the idea of "crowding out." He
believes there is room for 400 million companies to adopt this
standard.

## 4. The Shift to "Digital Credit" (STRC)
A major takeaway is Saylor’s focus on **Digital Credit**. He explains
that MicroStrategy isn't trying to *be* a bank, but rather the
"feedstock" for the global banking system.

* **Digital Gasoline:** Saylor envisions selling Bitcoin-backed credit
to traditional banks, allowing them to offer 8% yield accounts to
customers.
* **High-Powered Money:** By backing credit with the "apex property"
(Bitcoin), the entire global financial system becomes more stable and
efficient.

## 5. Why MicroStrategy is Holding USD
Saylor clarifies why the company recently started holding USD reserves
alongside Bitcoin. This move is strictly to **improve
creditworthiness**. By maintaining a cash buffer, the company reduces
the perceived risk for conservative credit investors, allowing
MicroStrategy to borrow at even lower rates to buy more Bitcoin.

## 6. Recommended Reading for Long-Term Thinking
To stay grounded during market volatility, Saylor recommends studying
history to understand the nature of power and property:

* **The Story of Civilization** by Will Durant (11 Volumes)
* **Conceived in Liberty** by Murray Rothbard
* **The Power Struggle:** Saylor views history as a "continual,
never-ending struggle over money, power, and property."

### Final Takeaway
While the market fixates on 90-day cycles, the real narrative is the
integration of Bitcoin into the **$300 trillion global credit
market**. Michael Saylor remains 100% focused on digital credit as the
base layer for the future of money.
