Below is a simplified, thread-style explanation (similar structure to the
screenshots), followed by a more technical appendix with math and a small
simulation.

1. Token Sales Are Generally Messy
Traditional token launches often look like this:

A fixed launch time.
Everyone tries to buy at once.
Bots and fast traders usually win.
The final “price” is unclear and volatile for the first hours or days.

Token Sales Are Generally Messy Traditional token launches often look like this:\nA fixed launch time. Everyone tries to buy at once. Bots and fast traders usually win. The final “price” is unclear and volatile for the first hours or days. This leads to:\nOver-paying by retail participants. Concentrated allocations in a few hands. Difficult price discovery and messy early trading. 2. The Old Token Launch Playbook Common mechanisms and their issues:\nFixed price sale Project sets a price. If price is too low, it sells out instantly to bots and arbitrageurs. If too high, sale drags and looks unsuccessful. Dutch auction (price goes down over time) Professional traders wait to buy as low as possible. Late sniping decides the outcome. Retail participants face a timing game they are not equipped for. One-shot uniform-price auction Everyone submits bids once. The market clears at a single price. But it happens only at one moment in time, and liquidity must be set up separately after. Direct AMM launch (e.g., immediate Uniswap pool) Pool starts with thin liquidity. Early trades move the price a lot. MEV and mempool competition influence who gets good fills. 3. CCA Flips the Script (Simple View) A Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA) changes the process:\nThe sale is split into many blocks (time intervals). You submit one bid with: Max price you are willing to pay. Amount of tokens you want. The protocol automatically spreads your bid across the whole sale. At each block, it computes a fair market price based on all active bids. Everyone who gets filled in that block pays the same price. You:\nDo not have to click fast. Do not have to watch the price every second. Just specify your maximum willingness to pay and size. 4. Here’s the Core Mechanism For each block:\nThe protocol has a fixed amount of tokens for that block. It looks at all active bids and sorts them by max price. It finds the lowest price at which total demand ≥ block supply. That price is the clearing price for the block. All bids with P_max at or above that clearing price are eligible. If there is more demand than supply at that price, eligible bids are scaled pro-rata. Everyone who is filled pays that same clearing price. This repeats on every block until the sale ends.\n5. “What If I Bid Too High?” The protocol enforces a max price guarantee:\nYou choose P_max (the most you are willing to pay per token). If the block’s clearing price P_clear is above your P_max: Your bid is not executed in that block. Your bid slices remain available for later blocks or can be withdrawn as the sale rules allow. Result:\nYou never pay more than P_max. If the market clears lower than your P_max, you simply get filled at the lower clearing price. 6. The “Early Bird” Effect In CCA:\nBidding early means your order is spread over more blocks. That gives you more opportunities to be filled in blocks where the clearing price is relatively low. If you wait until the last block: Your order only participates in the final blocks. You mostly see the later, potentially more expensive clearing prices. So, unlike “fastest finger first,” the mechanism encourages:\nEarly participation. Longer exposure to the full price discovery process. 7. When the Auction Ends At the end of the sale:\nThe protocol has: A full record of all clearing prices and filled quantities per block. Total raised assets. Remaining unsold tokens (if any). According to the configured rules: A portion of the raised assets and remaining tokens can be automatically deposited into a Uniswap v4 pool. This seeds initial liquidity at a price consistent with the auction outcome. This avoids a separate “now we figure out liquidity” phase and gives:\nA clear history of price discovery. Immediate secondary trading with pre-funded liquidity. 8. Why This Matters (Conceptually) CCA aims to:\nSeparate price discovery from low-level mempool / latency games. Provide a uniform price per block, not per individual transaction. Make it harder for: Bots to front-run retail participants. Whales to dominate purely via speed. Provide a direct bridge from token sale → liquidity bootstrapping on Uniswap v4. It is still an auction:\nThere is competition. Prices can go high or low. But the process is better structured and more transparent. 9. Technical Appendix: Simple Example With Math To make the mechanism concrete, consider a single-block example (one clearing event) first. A multi-block CCA just repeats this per block with bid slices.\n9.1 Assumptions Tokens available in this block: S = 1,000. 10 participants submit bids with: Maximum price P_max. Desired quantity Q. 9.2 Bids Participant Max Price P_max Quantity Q A 1.80 150 B 2.20 200 C 1.00 50 D 2.50 400 E 0.90 80 F 1.60 120 G 3.00 500 H 2.00 200 I 1.20 100 J 0.75 40 9.3 Build the Order Book Sort by P_max descending and accumulate demand:\nRank Participant P_max Q Cumulative Demand 1 G 3.00 500 500 2 D 2.50 400 900 3 B 2.20 200 1,100 4 H 2.00 200 1,300 5 A 1.80 150 1,450 … others ≤ 1.60 … … We first exceed the supply S = 1,000 when including participant B. Therefore the clearing price is:\n[ P_{\\text{clear}} = 2.20 ]\nEligible bidders are those with P_max ≥ 2.20:\nG: wants 500 D: wants 400 B: wants 200 Total eligible demand:\n[ D_{\\text{eligible}} = 500 + 400 + 200 = 1{,}100 ]\nWe must allocate only 1,000 tokens. Scale all eligible bidders pro-rata by factor:\n[ \\alpha = \\frac{S}{D_{\\text{eligible}}} = \\frac{1{,}000}{1{,}100} \\approx 0.909 ]\n9.4 Final Allocations Participant Demand Q Allocation Q × α Price Paid G 500 454.5 2.20 D 400 363.6 2.20 B 200 181.8 2.20 All other participants receive zero in this block:\nTheir P_max is strictly below the clearing price. They pay nothing and keep their capital. No one pays above their max, and everyone filled pays the same price.\nIn a real CCA:\nThe auction is split into many blocks. Each original bid is sliced across blocks. The per-block logic above is applied repeatedly. Over time, bidders experience a volume-weighted average of the clearing prices in the blocks where they are filled. 10. Short TL;DR You say how much you want and the most you’ll pay per token. The protocol spreads your bid across the sale. Each block computes a single fair price from all bids. If that price is at or below your max, you can be filled; if above, you are skipped. Everyone filled in a block pays the same price. At the end, funds and tokens can automatically seed a Uniswap v4 pool.

bid slices.</p><h3 id=91-assumptions>9.1 Assumptions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#91-assumptions>#</a></h3><ul><li>Tokens available in this block: <code>S = 1,000</code>.</li><li>10 participants submit bids with:</li><li>Maximum price <code>P_max</code>.</li><li>Desired quantity <code>Q</code>.</li></ul><h3 id=92-bids>9.2 Bids<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#92-bids>#</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>Participant</th><th>Max Price <code>P_max</code></th><th>Quantity <code>Q</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>1.80</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>2.20</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>1.00</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>2.50</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>0.90</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>1.60</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>G</td><td>3.00</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>2.00</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>1.20</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>J</td><td>0.75</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=93-build-the-order-book>9.3 Build the Order Book<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#93-build-the-order-book>#</a></h3><p>Sort by <code>P_max</code> descending and accumulate demand:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Participant</th><th><code>P_max</code></th><th><code>Q</code></th><th>Cumulative Demand</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>G</td><td>3.00</td><td>500</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>D</td><td>2.50</td><td>400</td><td>900</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>B</td><td>2.20</td><td>200</td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>H</td><td>2.00</td><td>200</td><td>1,300</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A</td><td>1.80</td><td>150</td><td>1,450</td></tr><tr><td>&mldr;</td><td>others</td><td>≤ 1.60</td><td>&mldr;</td><td>&mldr;</td></tr></tbody></table><p>We first exceed the supply <code>S = 1,000</code> when including participant B.
Therefore the <strong>clearing price</strong> is:</p><p>[
P_{\text{clear}} = 2.20

D_{\text{eligible}} = 500 + 400 + 200 = 1{,}100
]</p><p>We must allocate only 1,000 tokens.
Scale all eligible bidders <strong>pro-rata</strong> by factor:</p><p>[
