From Human “Colonizers” to Cosmic “Stomachs”: Microbial Life, the Spark Toward Humans, and Darwin-Like Selection in Quantum Physics</h1>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This article synthesizes a set of linked questions: (i) how many species live on or in humans and which “living beings” are closest to us as constant colonizers; (ii) whether anything sits alone atop Earth’s food chain; (iii) what kind of alien life we’re most likely to detect; (iv) whether meteorites such as Murchison could plausibly represent a pivotal “event” for life’s emergence; (v) what, specifically, could count as the “spark” that makes a human possible; and (vi) whether physics—especially quantum entanglement and decoherence—contains processes analogous to Darwinian evolution. The central unifying thread is information: in biology, information is copied and selected (Darwinian evolution); in physics, information can be preserved, dispersed, redundantly recorded, or filtered by stability, but not necessarily in a Darwinian way.</p>

<h2>1) What does “living on/in humans constantly” even mean?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You asked for all identified species, ordered “most to least,” that live on or in humans constantly. The immediate scientific complication is definitional:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>“All identified” is not a closed set; metagenomics keeps expanding catalogs (especially for viruses and uncultured microbes).</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>“Constantly” can mean “in every human,” “in most humans,” or “in humans as a species (the global pool).” Those differ dramatically.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>“Species” is straightforward for animals, less so for microbes and especially viruses (often defined by sequence clusters rather than classical species concepts).</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A practical compromise is to distinguish:</p>

<p>(A) the global human-associated pool vs (B) what a typical individual hosts at a time, and to treat viruses separately because many people do not consider them “alive.”</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>2) How many microbial species are human-associated (and which groups dominate by </h2>

<h2>species count</h2>

<h2>)?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>2.1 Global pool (across humans, multiple body sites)</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A widely cited NIH/HMP framing is that humans are hosts to roughly 10,000 bacterial species globally, while an individual hosts on the order of ~1,000 species at a time.  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Beyond that headline number, modern reference catalogs show why “all identified” keeps moving:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Gut bacteria/archaea (prokaryotes): The UHGG catalog reports 4,644 gut prokaryote species (species-level groups) from large-scale genome collection work.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Gut viruses (mostly bacteriophages): A large metagenomic survey reported &gt;140,000 gut viral “species” (sequence-defined groups), with many novel.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Fungi (mycobiome): Reviews note &gt;390 fungal species identified across human niches.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Archaea: Archaeal diversity is smaller than bacterial diversity but increasingly characterized; large genome-based surveys show substantial archaeal genome diversity in humans.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>2.2 “Most to least” by species richness (global, human-associated)</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>If you include viruses as “living,” then viruses likely dominate by species-level group counts in current catalogs; if you exclude them, bacteria dominate among cellular life. The rough ordering by identified diversity is:</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>Viruses (if counted) — extremely high diversity in gut virome catalogs.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Bacteria — thousands globally; ~10,000 species framing in NIH/HMP.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Fungi — hundreds identified across human body sites.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Archaea — fewer than bacteria, but nontrivial and better cataloged than historically appreciated.  </p>

</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>3) If we restrict to “things with a brain and a heart,” what are the closest human colonizers?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You proposed simplifying to organisms “closer to humans” (animals with nervous systems and a heart-like pump). That essentially shifts the discussion from microbiomes to ectoparasites and skin-associated arthropods. Here, “constant colonizer” becomes narrow: the most “normal” long-term residents are mites; lice and scabies are obligate human parasites but not universal; others (bed bugs, botflies, sand fleas) are human-associated but usually not permanent residents.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Top 10 animal colonizers / human-associated “resident-like” parasites (with one-sentence rationale)</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>(Ordered roughly from “most commonly present as a long-term resident” → “less common / more regional / more episodic.”)</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>Demodex folliculorum (face mite) — common on humans, living in hair follicles (notably eyelashes/face) often without symptoms.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Demodex brevis (face mite) — commonly found on humans, tending to inhabit sebaceous (oil) glands and follicles.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) — a blood-feeding parasite that lives on the scalp and lays eggs on hair shafts.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus/corporis) — typically resides and lays eggs in clothing seams, migrating to skin to feed; can persist with ongoing exposure conditions.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Pubic louse (Pthirus pubis) — a crab-like louse inhabiting coarse hair (usually pubic region), feeding on blood.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Scabies mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis) — fertilized females burrow into the top skin layer and lay eggs, enabling sustained colonization without treatment.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) — not a body resident, but a persistent human-associated blood feeder that lives near sleeping areas and repeatedly feeds on humans.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Tropical bed bug (Cimex hemipterus) — similarly human-associated, repeatedly feeding on people while residing in the environment (beds/furniture).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Sand flea / chigoe (Tunga penetrans) — adult females can burrow into skin (often feet) and remain embedded during egg production (tungiasis).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Human botfly (Dermatobia hominis) larvae — larvae can develop in human skin (furuncular myiasis) for weeks, but this is geographically limited and episodic.  </p>

</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Key caveat: only a few of these are plausibly “constant colonizers” in ordinary, healthy adults (notably Demodex). The rest are better described as parasites/infestations that can become persistent in the right social/ecological conditions.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>4) Who is “the ultimate master of Earth” at the top of the food chain?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You asked for a single being “on top of the food chain alone,” not getting eaten “like humans.” Ecologically, there’s a mismatch in the framing: apex predators can be hard to prey upon while alive, but no organism escapes being consumed by decomposers eventually.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A useful reframing is your later “stomach of the world” idea: the organisms that ultimately digest everything. In that framing, the closest answer is:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Decomposers—especially fungi and bacteria—complete food webs by breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>So if “master” means “final consumer / the biosphere’s stomach,” it’s microbial decomposers.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>If “master” means “dominant shaper of Earth’s surface right now,” you can argue for humans, but that’s a statement about technology and global impact—not immunity from being consumed in the long run.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>5) What’s the most likely alien life we’ll find?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Your intuition that the first aliens are likely microbial is consistent with mainstream astrobiology strategy: microbes are simpler, more robust, and can exploit chemical energy in dark environments (e.g., subsurface oceans). NASA discussions of Europa/Enceladus life-detection commonly emphasize biosignatures compatible with microbial life and the plausibility of sampling for such signatures.  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A second point you implicitly raised: we may detect biosignatures (chemical/isotopic/mineral patterns) before we ever “see” a cell. That’s why sample return and in situ life-detection are major priorities in Mars and ocean-world exploration.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>6) Is there a single “event” in world history like the Murchison meteorite delivering life’s building blocks?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You proposed something like: a carbonaceous meteorite delivers amino acids and other organics, seeding Earth with the building blocks for microbes. Murchison is a good symbol because we have strong evidence it contains abundant organics, including many amino acids, with isotopic signatures supporting extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Examples of the evidence:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Isotopic and enantiomeric analyses support that many Murchison amino acids are extraterrestrial rather than terrestrial contamination.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Reviews note dozens of amino acids identified in Murchison, with many more detected across carbonaceous meteorites.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>However: this is best viewed as one input stream, not “the origin event.” Early Earth likely received organics from multiple sources (endogenous synthesis + many impacts), across many environments.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>7) “Good luck explaining the origin of life”: a more specific, non-handwavy path to humans</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You pressed for a concrete “spark” rather than “billions of years happened.” The scientifically useful “spark” is not “a random amino acid,” but:</p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>7.1 The earliest spark that makes humans possible</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A self-copying system with heredity and variation capable of Darwinian evolution—often discussed as an RNA-like replicator (information storage + catalysis) coupled to compartments (protocells). This is the point where chemistry becomes an evolutionary process, not just reactions.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Work on fatty-acid vesicles encapsulating genetic polymers is one experimentally grounded line for how protocell-like systems could arise and couple growth with division.  </p>

<p>RNA-world literature motivates why RNA (or an RNA-like polymer) is attractive: it can carry information and catalyze reactions, enabling a bridge from chemistry to heredity.  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>7.2 The later spark “closest to a human”</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You also asked what’s “the spark of a human,” not just life. A strong candidate for the pivotal transition enabling complex multicellular life is:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Eukaryogenesis with mitochondria: mitochondria derive from an ancestral endosymbiotic alphaproteobacterium, and this event is tightly coupled to the rise of complex eukaryotic cellular architecture.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>From there, the path to humans is “standard” evolutionary history: multicellularity → animals → vertebrates → mammals → primates → hominins.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>8) Your physics analogy: chain reactions, heat mixing, and “matter competing to be the same”</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You proposed that physical processes—nuclear chains, fusion/fission transformations, even warm/cold air exchange—look like “competition,” “variation,” and “information preservation,” suggesting an RNA-like information flow in matter itself.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A careful synthesis is:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Many physical systems show amplification (e.g., chain reactions) and pattern formation (e.g., convection), and they can preserve information at the microscopic level.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>But Darwinian evolution requires a special ingredient: high-fidelity template-based copying with heritable variation, enabling cumulative adaptation.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Turbulent mixing and thermal equilibration typically erase usable macroscopic information (even if microscopic dynamics remain reversible in principle), which is the opposite of what genomes do.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>So your analogy works best if interpreted as: far-from-equilibrium physics can generate persistent structures, but open-ended Darwinian evolution needs templated heredity.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>9) Entanglement: “If A changes, B changes—so why doesn’t B’s environment change?”</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This was the core conceptual knot you kept returning to. The resolution is that there are two different things people call “state change”:</p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>9.1 What does change instantly (in the joint description)</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>If A and B are entangled, a measurement on A lets you update the conditional state you assign to B given the outcome at A.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>9.2 What does </h3>

<h3>not</h3>

<h3> change locally at B (without classical communication)</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Local physics at B is governed by B’s reduced state. The no-communication (no-signaling) principle says local operations/measurements on A cannot be used to transmit information to B faster than light; B’s local outcome statistics remain unchanged unless a classical signal arrives.  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>9.3 How entanglement is experimentally </h3>

<h3>proven</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You asked: “How do we influence it and prove it—do we need to change both sides at the same time?” A standard approach:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Choose measurement bases independently on each side,</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>record outcomes,</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>show the correlations violate a Bell inequality (e.g., CHSH), ruling out local hidden-variable explanations under the experiment’s assumptions.</p>

<p>A landmark “loophole-free” Bell test with separated systems is one example of this experimental strategy.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Answer to your timing question: you do not need to “change both sides simultaneously.” You need measurements on both sides and a correlation analysis; spacelike separation is used to prevent ordinary causal coordination.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>10) Is entanglement only “spin 0/1”? And does spin matter for fusion/fission?</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You asked whether entanglement is limited to two-state “spin up/down,” and whether spin has real physical consequences in nuclear processes.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>10.1 Entanglement degrees of freedom</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Entanglement can involve many degrees of freedom (polarization, path, energy/time bins, orbital angular momentum, etc.), and systems are not limited to two levels—qudits and continuous-variable entanglement exist in principle and practice.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>10.2 Does spin matter in fusion?</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Yes: reaction probabilities can depend on spin configurations. In particular, spin-polarized fusion is studied because aligning spins of reactants can increase cross sections.</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>First-principles nuclear calculations and fusion research discussions report that fully aligned D–T polarization can increase the D–T fusion cross section by ~50% (≈ factor 1.5) under ideal polarization assumptions.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This is a local effect: spin influences nuclear reaction channels and cross sections. It is not an example of “remote entanglement making distant matter behave differently.”</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>11) Your goal: an experiment where entanglement triggers a “Darwinistic reaction” on both sides</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You asked for the closest experiment where two entangled systems each interact with their local environments in a way that looks Darwinian—i.e., persistence + competition + emergence of stable “winners.”</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>The closest well-developed framework is Quantum Darwinism:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Decoherence filters out fragile superpositions.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>A small set of stable pointer states survives interaction with the environment (environment-induced superselection, “einselection”).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>The environment then stores many redundant records of the pointer-state information, enabling multiple observers to agree on the same “classical reality.”  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A recent superconducting-circuit experiment reports a comprehensive demonstration consistent with these Quantum Darwinism signatures (branching structure, redundancy / mutual information plateau behavior).  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p></p>

<h3>11.1 A concrete “two-sided” design that matches what you proposed</h3>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Step 1: Prepare A and B in an entangled state.</p>

<p>Step 2: Couple A to a local environment E_A (many ancilla qubits or photonic modes), and couple B to an independent local environment E_B.</p>

<p>Step 3: Engineer the coupling so that each environment “monitors” its system, selecting pointer states and imprinting redundant copies of the system’s classical information into many environment fragments.  </p>

<p>Step 4: Verify Darwinism-like behavior by showing that small fragments of E_A (and separately E_B) each reveal essentially the same pointer-state information (redundancy / plateau), while the underlying quantum coherences are suppressed.  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This is “Darwin-like” in a precise, limited sense:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Selection: pointer states are the stable survivors under decoherence.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Replication: the environment stores many copies (redundant records) of those survivors.  </p>

<p>What it is not: biological evolution’s open-ended adaptation via heritable variation across generations.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>12) Your universe-scale extension: black holes, expansion, and distant “chaos”</h2>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You suggested a speculative extrapolation: if distant systems are entangled (e.g., black hole interiors entangled with Hawking radiation or other cosmological degrees of freedom), perhaps “one side” could create changes or chaos elsewhere in a Darwin-like way.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A careful statement consistent with known constraints is:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Black holes and Hawking radiation raise deep questions about entanglement and information (the black hole information paradox, Page curve, etc.).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>There are speculative ideas linking entanglement and geometry (e.g., ER=EPR as a conjectured relationship between wormholes and entanglement).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>But entanglement alone does not provide a controllable causal channel: it reshapes correlations, not local dynamics in a way you can use to force distant environmental effects (no-signaling remains the operational constraint).  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>So your “black hole ↔ expansion ↔ creation” picture is best treated as a research-level speculation about global correlations, not as a mechanism for remote Darwin-like causal influence.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Conclusions (the shortest faithful summary of the whole arc)</h2>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>Humans host vast biodiversity, especially microbial; global catalogs suggest ~10,000 bacterial species associated with humans, ~1,000 per person at a time, gut prokaryote catalogs at 4,644 species, gut viromes at &gt;140,000 viral groups, and mycobiomes at &gt;390 fungal species.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>If you restrict to animals with “brain + heart,” the closest “colonizers” are mainly Demodex mites, plus lice and scabies as persistent parasites; others are more episodic or environment-dwelling (bed bugs, sand fleas, botfly larvae).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>No organism is “not eaten” in an ultimate sense; decomposers (bacteria/fungi) are the biosphere’s final digesters.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>The most likely first alien life is microbial, and we may detect biosignatures before organisms.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Meteorites like Murchison plausibly contributed organics (including amino acids) to early Earth, but they’re likely one part of a broader chemical supply chain.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>The most defensible “spark” for life is a templated, self-copying system capable of Darwinian evolution, plausibly in protocell-like compartments; the most defensible “spark” for human-level complexity is eukaryogenesis with mitochondria.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Entanglement creates strong nonclassical correlations, verified via Bell tests, but does not allow remote causal control of a distant environment (no-signaling).  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p>The closest thing to “Darwinism in physics” is Quantum Darwinism: decoherence selects stable pointer states and the environment replicates their information redundantly.  </p>

</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
