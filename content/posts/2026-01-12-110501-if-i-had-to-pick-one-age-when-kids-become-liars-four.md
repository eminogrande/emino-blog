> **Thesis:** If you force me to pick a single “switch” age when *lying becomes a stable, intentional tool* (not just noise, mistakes, or wishful answering), I pick **4 years old**.

That sentence sounds like a moral diagnosis. It isn’t.

This post is about a cognitive milestone: the moment children start
treating *your mind* as something separate from *their mind*—a private
“universe” with its own contents that can be **influenced**,
**misled**, and sometimes **exploited**.

A child who can lie is not automatically “bad.” A child who *cannot*
lie is not automatically “good.” Lying is better understood as a
**social-technology** that becomes possible once two pieces of
machinery start working together:

1. **Theory of mind** (ToM): tracking what someone else believes (even
when it’s wrong).
2. **Executive function** (EF): inhibiting the truth, holding the
story in working memory, and controlling “leakage.”

The hard part is that neither of these develops overnight. So why pick *four*?

Because **around 4**, multiple research lines converge on the same
practical claim:

- children’s **explicit false-belief understanding** becomes reliable,
- **self-protective lies** in classic lab paradigms become common, and
- the ability to tell a lie *and then keep it coherent* begins to show
up as an individual difference tied to ToM and EF.

Below is the evidence that makes “four” the best single-number
answer—even though reality is continuous.

## What counts as “lying” here (and what doesn’t)

A big chunk of confusion comes from calling everything untrue a “lie.”

In developmental psychology, *lying* is usually defined as
**intentional verbal deception**—not mistakes, misunderstandings,
fantasy play, or random “yes” answers.

One widely cited definition puts it bluntly:

> “Lying involves a speaker making a false statement with the intention to deceive the recepient.”
> — Talwar & Lee (open-access full text on PMC)

So, “I didn’t break it” while holding the broken thing is a lie.
“I have a dragon in my bedroom” (while playing) is not necessarily a lie.
And “No” to every question isn’t lying; it’s often just **response
bias**, **fear**, or **confusion**.

---

## Why *minds* matter: the “other universe” problem

Your question gestures at the key idea: *at some point, a child
realizes the other person has their own inner world.*

To lie successfully, the child has to model:

- what *really* happened, **and**
- what *you* currently believe, **and**
- what *you will believe* after hearing their statement.

That’s why false-belief understanding has been the workhorse test for
ToM. And when researchers argue about “when ToM emerges,” they often
argue about when children reliably pass false-belief tasks.

A classic meta-analysis pulled together the messy literature:

> “A meta-analysis was conducted (N = 178 separate studies) to address the empirical inconsistencies and theoretical controversies.”
> — Wellman, Cross, & Watson (2001)

and found that performance shows a consistent developmental pattern:

> “yielded a multiple R of .74 and an R2 of .55; thus, the model accounts for 55% of the variance”
> — Wellman, Cross, & Watson (2001)

You don’t have to treat false-belief tasks as perfect to accept the
big message: preschoolers move from systematically failing these tasks
to reliably passing them. That shift is exactly the kind of “other
universe” upgrade that makes strategic lying possible.

## The temptation-resistance paradigm: the lab’s “lying trap”

Most of the cleanest child-lying data comes from a deceptively simple setup:

1. Tell the child **don’t peek** at a toy while you leave.
2. Leave them alone (many peek).
3. Ask: **“Did you peek?”**
4. Optionally ask follow-ups that test whether they can maintain the
lie (avoid “semantic leakage”).

It’s called the **temptation resistance paradigm (TRP)**.

In one open-access study of 150 children aged 3–8:

> “Overall, 82% of the children (123) peeked at the toy in the experimenter’s absence”
> — Talwar & Lee

and among the peekers:

> “Of the 123 children who peeked, 79 (64%) children lied about their transgression.”
> — Talwar & Lee

That’s already a key point: **lying is common once the situation
pressures self-protection**.

But it still doesn’t tell us *the switch age*. For that we look at the
developmental model inside the same paper.

---

## The reason I pick **four**: “secondary lies” start winning

Talwar & Lee summarize a developmental progression often described in levels.

What matters here is their claim about an inflection between 3 and 4:

> “The second level, ‘secondary lies’, reflects a significant shift that takes place between 3 and 4 years of age.”
> — Talwar & Lee

And they make the practical statement you were asking for:

> “At and after 4 years of age, the majority of children will readily tell a lie to conceal their own transgression.”
> — Talwar & Lee

That sentence is why “four” is the best single-number answer.

Not because every 4-year-old lies all the time.
But because *before* 4, lying exists—yet it’s less reliable, less
strategic, and more vulnerable to “leakage.”
After 4, *lying to conceal a misdeed becomes the modal response* in
these paradigms.

## Why not pick 2.5? Because early “lies” look different

Parents often report “first lies” around toddlerhood. Experiments see
something related—but the pattern suggests it’s not yet full-strength,
belief-manipulating deception.

A large longitudinal study (N=252) tested 2.5-year-olds in a modified
TRP and found:

> “Results showed that 35% of 2.5-year-olds peeked, 27% of peekers lied and 40% of non-peekers falsely confessed they had peeked.”
> — Białecka-Pikul et al. (2022)

Notice how weird that is: **40% false confessions** among non-peekers.
That’s not a mature deception profile. It looks like a mix of
compliance, confusion, or poor inhibitory control.

The authors’ interpretation is directly relevant:

> “These results suggested that the first, or so-called primary, lies of 2.5-year-olds are probably spontaneous, rather than deliberate.”
> — Białecka-Pikul et al. (2022)

So if you pick 2.5, you risk calling “noise” a “switch.”

---

## Why not pick 7–8? Because that’s about *skill*, not *onset*

There’s a different milestone later: the ability to keep the lie
consistent under follow-up questioning.

Talwar & Lee note that lie maintenance relates to higher-order belief
understanding (thinking about what someone thinks about someone else’s
beliefs). In other words: **sophistication** keeps developing.

But if your goal is the first age where lying becomes a common,
deliberate concealment strategy, you don’t need to wait for 7–8. Four
is earlier and captures the onset of *secondary lies*.

---

## The “software update” view: ToM + EF predicts lying, but not strongly

If lying were *only* theory-of-mind, we’d expect huge correlations. We
don’t see that.

What we see are small-but-consistent associations across thousands of
children—exactly what you’d expect if ToM is necessary but not
sufficient.

A meta-analysis of lying and ToM (81 studies; 7,826 children) reports:

> “81 studies involving 7,826 children between 2 and 14 years of age”
> — Lee & Imuta (2021)

and:

> “there was a small, significant positive association (r = .23).”
> — Lee & Imuta (2021)

and importantly, the link is strongest where you’d expect ToM to matter most:

> “ToM was positively related to all facets of lying, but most strongly linked to lie maintenance”
> — Lee & Imuta (2021)

A second meta-analysis that also includes executive function (47
papers; 5,099 participants) finds:

> “In total, 47 papers consisting of 5099 participants between 2 and 19 years of age were included”
> — Sai et al. (2021)

and:

> “Statistically significant but relatively small effects were found between children’s lying and ToM (r = .17) and between lying and EF (r = .13).”
> — Sai et al. (2021)

Plus a nuance that supports the “skill vs onset” distinction:

> “EF’s correlation with children’s initial lies was significantly smaller than its correlation with children’s ability to maintain lies.”
> — Sai et al. (2021)

So: around 4, the machinery is coming online. After that, children
differ in *how good* they are—especially at maintaining a lie.

## “Does it stay?” Short-term stability shows up fast

Even if lying “begins” around preschool, you asked something deeper:
when does it become a stable behavior rather than a one-off?

A short-term longitudinal paper (open access) tested 104 preschoolers
three times across 4-month intervals:

> “we tested 104 normally developing children’s (64 boys, M = 54.0 months) false belief understanding and lie-telling behaviors three times at 4-month intervals.”
> — Wang, Gao, & Shao (2024)

They report:

> “Lie-telling behaviors exhibited moderate stability across the three time points”
> — Wang, Gao, & Shao (2024)

And critically for the “other universe” theory, the direction of
prediction runs from ToM to lying, not the other way:

> “Earlier false belief understanding significantly predicted children’s later lie-telling behavior”
> “earlier lie-telling did not predict later false beliefs understanding.”
> — Wang, Gao, & Shao (2024)

If you want “when it stays,” that kind of stability is the closest
thing we have to a quantitative answer: once the behavior is common
(post-4), it can already show measurable stability over months.

---

## Lying doesn’t disappear in adulthood—but it becomes *unevenly distributed*

If you follow lying into adult life, the story becomes less “everyone
lies constantly” and more “most people lie rarely; a few people lie a
lot.”

A classic diary-study report:

> “77 college students reported telling 2 lies a day, and 70 community members told 1.”
> — DePaulo et al. (1996)

And a large UK survey paper (N=2,980) summarizes the modern “long tail” view:

> “most people are honest most of the time and the majority of lies are told by a few prolific liars.”
> — Serota & Levine (2014)

They also state the sample clearly:

> “Participants (N = 2,980) were surveyed in the United Kingdom”
> — Serota & Levine (2014)

So yes: lying “stays” as a human behavior. But it doesn’t stay as a
constant rate for everyone.

## So: if I must choose one age, I choose **4 years old**

Here’s the clean argument.

### 1) Before 4, deception exists but often looks like “primary” behavior
Toddlers show denial, compliance errors, and false confessions in ways
that suggest limited deliberate belief-manipulation (e.g.,
2.5-year-olds: 27% of peekers lied; 40% of non-peekers falsely
confessed).

### 2) Around 4, deliberate concealment lies become the dominant
response in classic paradigms
Talwar & Lee explicitly describe a shift between 3 and 4 and state
that **at and after 4, the majority readily lie to conceal a
transgression**.

### 3) Around 4, “other minds” become tractable objects
False-belief performance shows a preschool conceptual change in a
large meta-analysis; meta-analyses show ToM is reliably (if modestly)
associated with lying, especially lie maintenance.

### 4) After 4, context and incentives can swing honesty dramatically
In 4–8-year-olds, changing appeals and punishment expectations moves
lying rates from ~46% to ~87% in one dataset—meaning the behavior is
now a strategic response, not just developmental noise.

### 5) After 4, you can already detect *stability* over time
Short-term longitudinal evidence finds moderate stability in
lie-telling across multiple time points and shows ToM predicts later
lying.

If you want a single age that best captures **“the switch from
truth-by-default to truth-as-a-strategy”**, it’s **four**.
