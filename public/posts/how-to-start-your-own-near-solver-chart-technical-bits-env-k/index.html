What this solver is and why it exists

The Near Intents protocol lets users express “I want to swap X for Y
under conditions Z” as intents.
A solver (this app) watches intents and acts as a market maker:

Keeps track of an on‑chain AMM pool (reserves for two NEP‑141
tokens).
Computes prices + margin for that pair.
When an intent is profitable (given your margin), it executes the
swap via your NEAR account.


The solver also exposes:

An HTTP status API (/status).
A dashboard (/dashboard) that shows health, reserves, quotes,
intents, balances.

Is reachable via: https://emino.app/status (JSON health). https://emino.app/solver/ (dashboard UI). ready:true and ws_connected:true → the solver is live and processing relay traffic. ———\n2. Walking through the components in the chart 2.1 User → Nginx → Solver A user opens https://emino.app/solver/ in a browser. Nginx vhost (emino.app): Terminates TLS using a Let’s Encrypt certificate. Has locations: /solver/ → proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4010/dashboard /status → proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4010/status The browser: Loads the HTML dashboard from /dashboard. The inline JS immediately calls /status and then polls it every few seconds for live data. The solver’s HttpService builds the payload for /status and renders the dashboard template for / dashboard. 2.2 The solver process (Node.js, pm2) The process is started roughly as:\nNODE_ENV=local pm2 start “npm start” –name near-solver\nnpm start runs: node -r tsconfig-paths/register -r ts-node/register src/main.ts The important files:\nsrc/main.ts Calls loadEnv() (from src/utils/load-env.ts). Then require(’./app’).app(). src/utils/load-env.ts Calls dotenv.config with: path: ./env/.env.local (because NODE_ENV=local). Validates process.env against a Joi schema (src/configs/env.validation.ts). Throws if anything required is missing/invalid. Copies validated values back into process.env. src/app.ts Instantiates services:\nconst cacheService = new CacheService(); const nearService = new NearService(); await nearService.init(); const intentsService = new IntentsService(nearService); const quoterService = new QuoterService(cacheService, nearService, intentsService); await quoterService.updateCurrentState(); const cronService = new CronService(quoterService); cronService.start(); const websocketSvc = new WebsocketConnectionService(quoterService, cacheService); websocketSvc.start(); const httpService = new HttpService(cacheService, quoterService, nearService); httpService.start();\nThis gives you:\nLive NEAR connection. AMM pricing + state. WebSocket stream from the solver relay. Periodic state refresh. HTTP API. 2.3 Services and their roles NearService\nUses near-api-js to construct connections: Network: NEAR_NETWORK_ID (mainnet or testnet). Node URLs: from NEAR_NODE_URLS or NEAR_NODE_URL, or defaults: Mainnet: https://free.rpc.fastnear.com, https://near.lava.build Testnet: https://test.rpc.fastnear.com, https://neart.lava.build Loads solver identity from env: NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID – your solver account, e.g. my-solver.near. NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY – an ed25519:… key string for that account. Exposes helpers: getBalance() – to show how much NEAR the solver holds (gas + liquidity). Make view calls / send signed transactions against NEAR contracts. IntentsService\nWraps the intents contract API (INTENTS_CONTRACT env if used). Lets the solver: Read pool data / reserves. Interact with intents (e.g., settlement logic). QuoterService\nKnows: The two token IDs (from AMM_TOKEN1_ID / AMM_TOKEN2_ID). The margin you want: MARGIN_PERCENT (e.g. 0.3 = 0.3%). Maintains an internal state snapshot: Reserves for each NEP‑141 token. Any other AMM parameters needed. Methods: updateCurrentState() – fetches fresh on‑chain pool state via NearService and IntentsService. Methods invoked by WebSocket events to adjust state per new quotes/intents. Quoter decides whether a given intent is worth executing given your current pool and margin. CacheService\nIn‑memory key‑value cache. Keys you’ll see: ws_connected – boolean. ws_last_event_at – timestamp of last relay event. reserves – current pool reserves. reserves_updated_at – when reserves were last refreshed. recent_quotes – list of latest quotes. recent_intents – list of latest intents with tx hashes. total_supply – cached for 60s so you don’t spam NEAR RPC. WebsocketConnectionService\nConnects to the solver relay: RELAY_WS_URL – e.g. wss://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/ws. RELAY_AUTH_KEY – a JWT / auth token issued by the relay operator. Behavior: Opens a WebSocket. Authenticates using the auth key. Receives: New quotes (price offers). New intents (user swap requests). Execution/settlement updates. For each event: Updates CacheService with recent quotes/intents and timestamps. Tells QuoterService about relevant changes so prices and state are fresh. CronService\nRuns a periodic job (e.g. every 5–10 seconds depending on implementation) that: Calls QuoterService.updateCurrentState(). Ensures that even if WebSocket traffic stutters, the solver’s picture of the pool stays correct. HttpService\nPure Node http server; no Express. Listens on APP_PORT (in your case 4010). Routes: / – simple JSON: { ready: true } /status – builds a full status payload: ready – constant true if process is up. ws_connected, ws_last_event_at. reserves + reserves_updated_at. margin_percent. recent_quotes, recent_intents. deposit_addresses – BTC + EURe deposit addresses. near_balance – yocto NEAR. near_balance_near – human-readable NEAR via a formatYocto helper. total_supply – token supplies via ft_total_supply view calls. /dashboard – returns a static HTML page with embedded JS: Injects bootstrap data = current /status JSON. Injects the list of token IDs and token meta (symbols, decimals). Renders a grid of cards: Health + readiness. Deposit addresses. WebSocket status. Reserves on the intents contract. Total supply on NEAR. Recent quotes. Recent intents. Starts a loop that re‑calls /status every few seconds and updates the UI. ———\n3. External systems The solver doesn’t live in isolation; it’s part of this broader system:\nSolver relay (RELAY_WS_URL): A central hub that feeds intents and quotes to registered solvers. You authenticate via RELAY_AUTH_KEY. Solvers send signed transactions that correspond to accepted intents. NEAR RPC nodes: Used for: View calls (e.g. ft_total_supply, pool state). Sending transactions from NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID. The solver uses multiple URLs for redundancy and simple failover. Intents contract (INTENTS_CONTRACT): Holds the logic and pools for EURe/BTC (and other pairs). Manages reserves and settlement. Deposit addresses (off-chain bridge): BTC mainnet address: where users send BTC. EURe (Gnosis) address: where users send EURe tokens. A separate bridge system (outside this repo) watches those and mints / burns the corresponding NEP‑141 tokens on NEAR. ———\n4. How to start your own solver (step-by-step) This section turns the chart into a checklist.\n4.1 Prerequisites A machine or VPS (Linux) with: Node.js 20+ npm or pnpm A NEAR account dedicated to the solver, e.g. your-solver.near: Never use your personal main wallet; create a new account just for the solver. Fund it with enough NEAR for gas + desired liquidity. A full access private key for that solver account: Export from NEAR CLI or wallet; format must be ed25519:…. This must be kept secret. Never commit it to git, never paste into chat, never share it. A relay auth key (RELAY_AUTH_KEY): Provided by the relay / intents operator. Usually a JWT-like token that identifies your solver. Optionally: A domain name + TLS (e.g. a subdomain like solver.example.com) if you want a nice dashboard URL. Nginx to proxy from HTTPS to the internal port. 4.2 Clone and install git clone https://github.com/near-intents/near-intents-examples.git cd near-intents-examples/near-intents-amm-solver\nUsing npm npm install\n(Replace repo URL with whichever remote you’re actually using.)\n4.3 Create and fill your env file The solver looks for env in ./env/.env..\nFor local/dev, we typically use NODE_ENV=local, so:\ncd near-intents-examples/near-intents-amm-solver mkdir -p env cp env/.env.example env/.env.local\nOpen env/.env.local and set:\nRequired core variables\nNetwork NEAR_NETWORK_ID=mainnet\nTokens for this solver (example: EURe ↔ BTC) AMM_TOKEN1_ID=nep141:gnosis-0x420ca0f9b9b604ce0fd9c18ef134c705e5fa3430.omft.near AMM_TOKEN2_ID=nep141:btc.omft.near\nNon-TEE mode (simplest setup) TEE_ENABLED=false\nYour solver NEAR account (dedicated!) NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-solver.near NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:YOUR_SOLVER_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\nNode / relay / margin\nNEAR RPC – you can override; otherwise defaults are fine NEAR_NODE_URL=https://rpc.mainnet.near.org\nor: NEAR_NODE_URLS=https://free.rpc.fastnear.com,https://near.lava.build Relay endpoint and auth RELAY_WS_URL=wss://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/ws RELAY_AUTH_KEY=YOUR_RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN\nHTTP server port for the solver APP_PORT=3000 # or 4010 on your server\nLogging and margin LOG_LEVEL=info # error | warn | info | debug MARGIN_PERCENT=0.3 # 0.3% margin, adjust to your risk ONE_CLICK_API_ONLY=true\nNotes:\nThe Joi schema (src/configs/env.validation.ts) will enforce: AMM_TOKEN1_ID, AMM_TOKEN2_ID are required. Either TEE mode or NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID/NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY must be set appropriately. MARGIN_PERCENT must be positive. If the solver fails at startup with a validation error, it will list which env variables are missing or invalid.\n4.4 Run locally From the solver directory:\nMake sure you’re in near-intents-amm-solver NODE_ENV=local npm start\nYou should see logs like:\nUsing Near RPC nodes: … Cron service started WebSocket logs like Received intent: {…} once connected. Check:\ncurl http://localhost:3000/status # or your APP_PORT\nAnd open in browser:\nhttp://localhost:3000/dashboard You should see the Solver Monitor dashboard.\n4.5 Run in the background with pm2 (production-ish) On your server:\ncd /path/to/near-intents-examples/near-intents-amm-solver\nNODE_ENV=local pm2 start “npm start” –name near-solver pm2 save pm2 startup # sets up pm2 to auto-start on boot\nCheck logs:\npm2 logs near-solver –lines 50\nCheck HTTP:\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:3000/status\n(Use your APP_PORT.)\n4.6 Put it behind Nginx + TLS (optional but recommended) Basic Nginx server block (for a domain solver.example.com):\nserver { listen 443 ssl http2; server_name solver.example.com;\nssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/ solver.example.com/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ solver.example.com/privkey.pem;\nlocation / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000; # APP_PORT proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; } }\nFor your specific setup on emino.app, we instead:\nKeep the existing blog at /. Add: Already configured in your vhost: location = /solver/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4010/dashboard; … }\nlocation /solver/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4010/; … }\nlocation /status { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4010/status; … }\nThen:\nnginx -t systemctl reload nginx\nNow your solver is reachable at:\nhttps://yourdomain/solver/ – dashboard. https://yourdomain/status – status JSON. ———\n5. Security and operational notes Keys: Use a dedicated NEAR account for the solver. The private key must have full access, or the solver can’t send txs. Treat NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY and RELAY_AUTH_KEY as secrets: Store in .env.local on the server. Make sure the repo directory is not world-readable. Never commit .env* files to git. Funds: Only keep as much liquidity/NEAR as you are willing to risk. Withdraw profits periodically; think of the solver account as a “hot wallet”. Monitoring: pm2 logs near-solver for runtime behavior. curl /status for programmatic monitoring (you could plug this into Prometheus / a health check). Upgrades: Pull new code, run npm install if dependencies changed. Restart with pm2 restart near-solver. https://mermaid.emino.app/?c=eJx1Vt1u6zYMfhXCwLk6-WmKYcNyMaAJip0ztFkXtygwpSgUW4m1Y0s-kuIkWHe7B9gj7klGSvJP0B0EsE3qI0V-JKX8mWQ6F8k82RteF3C33iiADx_gyQoDH0EoZ861lsqR3h62AUarpABYsIXRRxI3qnCutvPpVFRS6Qmv66nVZSPM9IWwQuUbdeHlNt8LtklWe6lOuNfjXQqss33ZJC9hixULiKbQ1uE2A8jQ7QLG45_eNsmnx8eHFNqtgT19fkGjVuu4O1hgv6S_rnCHN1gFY8w49QZQG50Jay8CDUsYqhLcjJEMpMWOeVWNwy7A6up6Dn41aPro77lUrMLHxFmMo9Q8v1UNOA1tBgA3dc1QCoijNAKQ0EZiHBHwCZll9EiDHmG1Ng6-u5pd4XdMawTTnNtiq7nJo-Fzyp7F1ursi3BLrZTInNSq92JEyc-AkNRDICsl5haNl0YrRo_BrsJIncsMjNgZYYuI_O2gHRIUXj365v4e-ZSZVHusLwUpWtc8KwTzzx4u1bgSlTZnhGrTQlfIKqNHD1zd3qxh_bAkp3KviG4P_Rwqw-J76NkrINPYzzxzUIiyjmZdA2EPkKFRvAQsAgZNWqofdRYViWR8eZGqMZSf06FErA3lwMwFgnIfKijFoRyT6GKjDoZdqY8kr2KzY7eezn2zY1fNrn-YXOFvNqfm6BuCihfBYQbeY8MCTUWbHL0vo-00fUadqs2gVWB8NGdINi9d4buN-lpgo34la3zHwoxgy0uusOFp90WX84JnX_ZGH1QOf-itH0piNjrHD7I3DS_JrI8ofEWUbzuwite20M5vELOJm6z9DHxsY-k47s-pU-gKPADaT7Bn60RluzH3Tlg8Q7xAo2zpOAzFGftRGzfXk8mktXlYsq6VFR7DNP47bh0dJCMoecNHYOpsQseHEu6yy5dtm3ddjda3T2tBlV08LqHWuowmKDJSRUeQi1pbSQazu4X8vQ-J7Jl3guT-rBBEMV2dZj9-v2xR3cAE4ojlUM4Bh3hznEQGhzpH8u1bnI7nNNYk6H1HZIh_jfZTiHJ04yl8zcK5JXJcL5GdV9Hg4qCOA8c7gTC_boct4aNFkgnUSHGEjJelbY-PHNwJY2zbt6V1MITLgX75fjqJ2pgYXZuRXQqfVkr59SBz6c4U0dCh5_n_7fzSNwzfdXguMpkLurl20vFtKaDnj-Po8AonKBAy3J7ybWcEaSA2qLQbZY8cr27hHHpCZoZ2yShxEvXtH4Y5XN7f3d0M__79D3zj3iYn55p80KhlBTcu-es_a-zoSA\nPost created via email from emin@nuri.com\n","wordCount":"1595","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-02T08:55:02Z","dateModified":"2025-12-02T08:55:02Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/how-to-start-your-own-near-solver-chart-technical-bits-env-k/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
