It’s a toolbox of overlapping proposals: global broadcasting, recurrent loops, dendritic integration, predictive control, and large-scale network coordination.\nA helpful way to read this post:\neach thinker/model is trying to solve a specific part of the puzzle; no one model explains everything yet; the strongest progress comes from combining insights, not picking a cult favorite. Searle John Searle argues consciousness is a real biological feature of brains, not software-level abstraction floating free of biology.\nIn plain language:\nbrains cause consciousness the way stomachs cause digestion; experience is natural, but not reducible to pure computation. Why useful:\nkeeps the discussion grounded in biology; rejects both dualist mysticism and “mind is just code” shortcuts. Main criticism:\nsaying consciousness is “biological” is directionally right, but we still need the mechanism. Block Ned Block’s famous contribution is the split between:\naccess consciousness (information available for report, decision, control), and phenomenal consciousness (what it feels like from the inside). Why this matters for neuroscience: A model may explain reportability without fully explaining subjective feel. Block prevents us from mistaking one for the other.\nEdelman Gerald Edelman proposed dynamic selectionist models (often associated with neural Darwinism): neural groups compete, stabilize, and coordinate through reentrant signaling.\nTakeaway for non-specialists: Consciousness may depend less on one “magic center” and more on ongoing large-scale coordination across changing brain populations.\nCrick–Koch Crick and Koch helped normalize serious consciousness science by framing it as a solvable biological research problem and by pushing the search for NCCs (neural correlates of consciousness).\nTheir legacy:\nmake the field test-driven; focus on specific circuits and timing; move from abstract metaphysics to measurable hypotheses. Baars / Dehaene (Global Workspace) Global Workspace Theory (Baars) and Global Neuronal Workspace (Dehaene and colleagues) suggest conscious content is information that gets globally broadcast so many systems can use it.\nSimple version:\nunconscious processing is local and specialized; conscious processing is globally available and report-ready. Strength: Excellent fit with many attention, report, masking, and ignition findings.\nLimit: Still debated whether global availability explains phenomenal feel itself or mainly cognitive access.\nCalvin William Calvin has explored large-scale cortical pattern dynamics and timing architectures relevant to thought and awareness.\nValue in this map: He represents efforts to explain consciousness through distributed pattern evolution rather than point-location modules.\nSergent Claire Sergent’s work on conscious access timing (especially near-threshold paradigms) helped sharpen the neural timeline of awareness.\nWhy important: Consciousness is not only where in the brain, but when and how quickly information becomes globally usable.\nPrinz Jesse Prinz proposes attention-based and intermediate-level representational views: consciousness tracks attended intermediate representations.\nIn plain words: Not every brain representation becomes conscious; attention and representational format matter.\nBach Kent Bach appears here in relation to representational and conceptual clarity in mind theories.\nPractical contribution: He helps keep distinctions clean between having information, accessing it, and experiencing it.\nCircuits / Cycles This point summarizes a broad consensus trend:\nConsciousness likely depends on circuit motifs and cyclical interactions (thalamocortical loops, recurrent cortical interactions, oscillatory synchrony, feedback cycles), not one feed-forward pass.\nDendritic Computation Recent work emphasizes dendrites as active computational units, not passive wires.\nWhy this is exciting: If single neurons do richer local computation than old models assumed, the biological basis of conscious integration may be more powerful (and more nuanced) than classic neural-net simplifications.\nNorthoff Georg Northoff focuses on spatiotemporal brain dynamics and self-related processing.\nCore idea: Consciousness may require specific temporal and spatial organization of brain activity, including resting-state structure, not just stimulus-response events.\nThis helps explain why baseline brain state strongly shapes experience.\nBunge Mario Bunge defended scientifically serious, system-oriented materialism that resists both dualism and hand-wave reduction.\nWhy relevant: Bunge-style thinking pushes for mechanistic clarity while respecting level-specific explanation.\nSapolsky Robert Sapolsky contributes broad biological context: behavior and cognition emerge from layered causes (genes, development, hormones, environment, social structure, immediate neural state).\nImplication for consciousness: Single-level stories are usually wrong. Conscious awareness is embedded in multi-timescale biology.\nFree Agents Debate This point captures the agency question inside neurobiology:\nIf conscious decisions correlate with measurable neural preparation, what remains of free will?\nImportant nuance: The debate is no longer “free or not free” in a cartoon sense. It’s about what kind of control, self-modeling, and policy selection conscious systems can implement in real biological constraints.\nHirstein William Hirstein’s work on confabulation, self-representation, and neuropsychological syndromes reminds us of something crucial:\nOur first-person certainty can be systematically distorted by brain damage or dysfunction.\nWhy this matters: Consciousness theories must explain not only normal experience, but also pathological edge cases where self-models break.\nWhat this whole column gets right It is testable. It is cumulative. It ties philosophy to data. It explains many features of conscious access, report, and integration. What it still struggles with Why specific neural dynamics feel like something from inside. How to bridge mechanism and phenomenology without hand-waving. How to unify competing models into one mature framework. Bottom line (plain language) Neurobiological theories are currently our strongest empirical path. They don’t solve everything, but they give real traction and real predictions.\nIf you care about truth over ideology, this column is essential: it forces every philosophical claim to eventually face the brain.\n","wordCount":"890","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-20T23:05:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-20T23:05:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/2026-02-21-100001-neurobiological-theories-of-consciousness-a-practical-map/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
