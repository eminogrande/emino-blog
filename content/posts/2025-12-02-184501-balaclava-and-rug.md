I was asked to edit an image. I took the original photo of the girl in the
balaclava and rug. First, I changed the orange knit balaclava to a deep
gold color. Then, I added large, prominent golden Bitcoin logos to the
yellow jacket and made the existing logos on the rug bigger and more
noticeable. The final image shows all these changes.
