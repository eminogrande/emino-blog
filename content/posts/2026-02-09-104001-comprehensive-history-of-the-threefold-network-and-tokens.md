The ThreeFold Network is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) internet
infrastructure project. It provides a global grid of computing,
storage, and network capacity owned by the community rather than
centralized providers.

## 1. Project Inception and Vision (2016 – 2017)
* **Founding**: ThreeFold was established in 2016 by a team of
internet veterans led by Kristof De Spiegeleer.
* **Core Philosophy**: The mission was to create a "People’s Internet"
that is open-source, neutral, and highly secure.
* **Technical Development**: The foundation for the network was the
development of **Zero-OS**, a lightweight operating system that
removes the need for human intervention in server management
(Self-Healing and Autonomous).

## 2. Infrastructure Evolution: The Grid Versions
The network has evolved through several iterations to scale its
capacity and transition toward a commercial marketplace.

* **Grid v1.0 & v2.0 (2018 – 2019)**: These early versions focused on
testing the "Proof-of-Capacity" model, where users (Farmers) were
rewarded for proving their hardware was connected to the grid.
* **Grid v3.0 (2020 – 2025)**: This era saw the network expand to a
global scale, utilizing the Stellar blockchain to manage capacity. At
its peak, the grid reached over 80 million GB of capacity across
thousands of nodes in more than 20 countries.
* **Grid v4.0 (2026 – Future)**: Launched in early 2026, this version
represents a shift to a "Utilization-based" economy. It introduces a
marketplace where users rent "slices" of computing resources directly
from Farmers, who set their own pricing.

## 3. The History of ThreeFold Tokens (TFT, SPORE, AUR)
ThreeFold employs a multi-asset ecosystem to balance rewards for
infrastructure providers with predictable pricing for end-users.

### The ThreeFold Token (TFT)
* **Launch**: TFT was introduced as the primary utility token of the network.
* **Minting Model**: Unlike most cryptocurrencies, TFT was never sold
in an ICO. It is only "minted" when a Farmer adds active hardware to
the grid.
* **Blockchain Rails**: Originally built on the Stellar network, TFT
later expanded via bridges to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and the native
TF Chain (Substrate).
* **Token Cap**: The total supply is strictly capped at 4 billion tokens.

### The New v4 Economy: SPORE and AUR
As of February 2026, the network is transitioning to a more commercial
economic model.

* **SPORE**: The new primary utility and reward token for v4.
    * It is used for paying for grid services and as the payout for Farmers.
    * The network has provided a one-way bridge for users to convert
their legacy TFT tokens into SPORE to join the v4 ecosystem.
* **AUR**: A gold-backed stablecoin introduced to provide price
stability for corporate and enterprise users.
    * This allows users to pay for computing "slices" without being
exposed to the volatility of traditional crypto markets.

## 4. Key Milestones and Timeline
* **2016**: Project founded; initial development of Zero-OS begins.
* **2018**: Early Grid versions launch; first ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) are minted.
* **2020**: Launch of Grid 3.0 on the Stellar blockchain.
* **2021**: Major growth phase, surpassing 80 PB of storage capacity globally.
* **2024**: The community votes to transition from a "Capacity-based"
to a "Utilization-based" reward model.
* **Feb 8, 2026**: Official termination of minting rewards on the v3
grid; mandatory migration to the v4 marketplace begins.
* **2026+**: Launch of the v4 Marketplace, AUR stablecoin, and options
to convert rewards into BTC, ETH, and USDC.
