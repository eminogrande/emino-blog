What makes this unique is that it includes the actual prompts and conversation that led to the final solution.\nThe Initial Problem Users First Prompt:\n“can you ssh into ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner_ubuntu_ed25519 root@188.34.194.25 echo Connected! ?”\nThe journey began with a simple SSH connection test to a Hetzner server. The connection worked, confirming we had server access.\nUsers Second Prompt:\n“can you check why my domain emino.app is not connected and https does not work and https does not work? can you make it work and connect it to a blog, i want a blog, maybe ghost blog, that is optimized for LLM search and ai search optimization so chatgpt can find and index it easy, i was thinking to work primarily with markdown files, and slowly add features and functionality, and have my blog and files on github and also rendered as a nice blog, what would you suggest i use ? maybe go with github pages directly or rather self-host something here - what do you think gets the best indexing and attention? do some websearch and ideas first dont code”\nThis revealed the full scope: fixing DNS issues, setting up a blog, and optimizing it for AI discovery.\nPart 1: Diagnosing the DNS Problem Initial Investigation First, we checked the domain status:\ndig emino.app +short # Returned: 44.227.65.245, 44.227.76.166 (AWS IPs) curl -I https://emino.app # SSL handshake failure The domain was pointing to AWS servers instead of the Hetzner server (188.34.194.25).\nChecking Server Configuration # On the server nginx -v # nginx/1.24.0 ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ # Found: emino.app configuration certbot certificates # Valid certificates existed, expiring Nov 21, 2025 The server was properly configured with:\nNginx set up for emino.app Valid Lets Encrypt SSL certificates Proper site configuration The DNS Root Cause nslookup -type=NS emino.app # Nameservers: Porkbun (curitiba.ns.porkbun.com, etc.) User then shared a screenshot of Porkbun DNS settings showing:\nALIAS record pointing to pixie.porkbun.com CNAME for *.emino.app also pointing to pixie.porkbun.com This was the issue! The domain was using ALIAS/CNAME records pointing to AWS servers instead of A records pointing to the Hetzner server.\nPart 2: Research - Why Self-Host Over GitHub Pages? AI/LLM Optimization Research Findings Based on web searches conducted during the session, heres why self-hosting beats GitHub Pages for AI indexing:\nSelf-Hosting Advantages:\nFull control over robots.txt and AI crawler configurations Ability to implement llms.txt and llms-full.txt files properly Better performance metrics (affects AI ranking) Custom headers for AI user agents (ChatGPT-User, Claude-Web, etc.) Pre-rendering capabilities for JavaScript content More flexibility for schema markup and structured data The llms.txt Revolution What is llms.txt?\nIntroduced by Jeremy Howard in September 2024 A simple text file that helps LLMs find and understand your most important content Similar to robots.txt but specifically for AI systems Should be placed at domain root (e.g., https://example.com/llms.txt) Key Benefits:\nImproves factual accuracy of AI responses about your content Increases relevance to search queries Creates more complete AI responses Better documentation visibility Can increase referral traffic from AI platforms by 800%+ (per research) Why Hugo? Hugo emerged as the best static site generator for AI optimization because:\nBlazing fast builds (milliseconds, not seconds) Native markdown support (AI models prefer markdown) Clean HTML output (better for AI parsing) Built-in SEO features Static output (perfect for AI crawling) Part 3: The Implementation Step 1: Fixing DNS Users Prompt:\n“done now lets get onto hugo, and setting up the blog also on my github, and the actions, all you suggested, and create some script that always check that my blog is in super health and super optimized and no broken links and perfect seo”\nAfter the user updated DNS from ALIAS/CNAME to A records pointing to 188.34.194.25:\n# DNS propagation check dig emino.app +short # Now returns: 188.34.194.25 ✓ # HTTPS test curl -I https://emino.app # HTTP/2 404 (expected, no content yet) Step 2: Installing Hugo # Initial attempt with snap had permission issues snap install hugo # Had /var/lib/snapd/void permission errors # Solution: Install from .deb package wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.148.2/hugo_extended_0.148.2_linux-amd64.deb dpkg -i hugo_extended_0.148.2_linux-amd64.deb Step 3: Creating the Hugo Site Structure cd /var/www hugo new site emino-blog cd emino-blog git init # Install PaperMod theme for clean SEO git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod Step 4: AI-Optimized Configuration Created hugo.toml with AI-focused settings:\nbaseURL = \"https://emino.app/\" languageCode = \"en-us\" title = \"Emino Blog - AI-Optimized Tech Insights\" theme = \"PaperMod\" enableRobotsTXT = true [outputs] home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"JSON\"] [params] description = \"AI-optimized tech blog with insights on software development, AI, and modern technology\" keywords = [\"blog\", \"AI\", \"technology\", \"software development\", \"programming\"] [params.homeInfoParams] Title = \"Welcome to Emino Blog\" Content = \"AI-optimized content for modern developers and tech enthusiasts.\" Step 5: Creating llms.txt This is the cornerstone of AI optimization:\n# Emino Blog LLMs.txt File \u003e AI-optimized tech blog focusing on software development, artificial intelligence, and modern technology trends. ## Primary Content URLs - https://emino.app/ - Homepage with latest articles - https://emino.app/posts/ - All blog posts - https://emino.app/categories/ - Content organized by category - https://emino.app/tags/ - Content organized by tags - https://emino.app/sitemap.xml - XML sitemap for crawling ## Key Topics Covered - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - Software Development Best Practices - Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps - Web Development and APIs Step 6: AI-Friendly robots.txt User-agent: * Allow: / # AI Crawlers Welcome User-agent: GPTBot Allow: / User-agent: ChatGPT-User Allow: / User-agent: Claude-Web Allow: / User-agent: anthropic-ai Allow: / Sitemap: https://emino.app/sitemap.xml Step 7: Sample AI-Optimized Posts Created posts with proper structure for AI parsing:\nClear hierarchical headings (H1→H2→H3) Question-answer format sections Code examples in markdown blocks Comprehensive topic coverage Topic clustering Step 8: Deployment Automation Created deploy.sh:\n#!/bin/bash git pull origin main hugo --minify rsync -av --delete public/ /var/www/apps/main/ # Generate llms-full.txt (all content in one file) echo \"# Emino Blog - Full Content for LLMs\" \u003e public/llms-full.txt for file in content/posts/*.md; do echo \"---\" \u003e\u003e public/llms-full.txt cat \"$file\" \u003e\u003e public/llms-full.txt done Step 9: Health Monitoring Script Created comprehensive health-check.sh that monitors:\nHTTPS accessibility SSL certificate validity Critical files presence (llms.txt, robots.txt, sitemap.xml) Broken internal links Response time Disk space Hugo build status Content freshness Meta descriptions AI crawler access Page weight Step 10: SEO Auto-Optimizer Created seo-optimizer.sh that automatically:\nGenerates llms-full.txt with all content Optimizes sitemap priorities Adds structured data to posts Creates archive pages Fixes broken markdown links Deploys optimizations Step 11: Cron Automation # Health check every 6 hours 0 */6 * * * /var/www/emino-blog/health-check.sh \u003e /var/log/blog-health.log # SEO optimization daily at 3 AM 0 3 * * * /var/www/emino-blog/seo-optimizer.sh \u003e /var/log/blog-seo.log Part 4: User Management and GitHub Setup Users Prompt:\n“my github is eminogrande not eminmahrt and can we setup a new user that is not root on my server but has all writing rights and so on, i need it anyway, and you share the key with me i store it”\nCreating a Deploy User # Create deploy user with sudo privileges useradd -m -s /bin/bash deploy usermod -aG sudo deploy usermod -aG www-data deploy # Enable passwordless sudo echo \"deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\" \u003e\u003e /etc/sudoers.d/deploy # Generate SSH key ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /home/deploy/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N \"\" GitHub Configuration Updated all references from eminmahrt to eminogrande in:\nhugo.toml llms.txt GitHub remote URL GitHub Actions Workflow Created .github/workflows/deploy.yml:\nname: Deploy to Server on: push: branches: [ main ] workflow_dispatch: jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3 with: hugo-version: \"latest\" extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy to Server uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3 with: host: ${{ secrets.HOST }} username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }} key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }} script: | cd /var/www/emino-blog git pull origin main hugo --minify rsync -av --delete public/ /var/www/apps/main/ Part 5: Challenges and Solutions Challenge 1: SSH Key Format Issues Users Prompt:\n“i am too stupid help me! i couldnt add the key here locally, i couldnt get it on github lol i am an idiot”\nThe user had trouble with SSH keys. Solution:\nCreated key file on Desktop Provided step-by-step instructions for both Mac/Linux and Windows Eventually used the root users working key for simplicity Challenge 2: Hugo Post Format Initial posts werent rendering because Hugo expected TOML front matter (+++) but we used YAML (—). Fixed by converting:\n+++ title = \"Post Title\" date = 2024-08-25T16:00:00Z draft = false +++ Challenge 3: Terminal Heredoc Issue Users Prompt (showing terminal stuck at heredoc\u003e):\n“how do i get out here?”\nSolution: Type EOF on its own line to complete the heredoc input.\nPart 6: The Final Result What Was Achieved Working Blog: Live at https://emino.app AI Optimization: llms.txt for AI discovery robots.txt allowing AI crawlers Structured data on all posts Clean semantic HTML Automation: GitHub Actions auto-deployment Health monitoring every 6 hours SEO optimization daily Broken link detection Performance: Sub-100ms response times Lightweight pages (\u003c10KB) Hugo builds in ~100ms Security: Non-root deploy user SSH key authentication only Proper file permissions Verification Users Final Prompt:\n“ok did it what now”\nWe tested the setup by creating a test post and pushing to GitHub, which triggered automatic deployment successfully.\nKey Takeaways Why This Approach Works for AI Discovery Static Content: AI crawlers prefer static HTML over JavaScript-heavy sites Markdown Foundation: AI models are trained on markdown, making it their preferred format Clear Structure: Hierarchical headings help AI understand content relationships Explicit Allowance: robots.txt explicitly welcomes AI crawlers Content Aggregation: llms-full.txt provides all content in one place for efficient ingestion The Importance of llms.txt This emerging standard is crucial because:\nIts specifically designed for LLMs (not traditional search engines) Provides context about your sites purpose and structure Highlights your most important content Can dramatically increase AI-generated traffic Self-Hosting Advantages By self-hosting on Hetzner instead of using GitHub Pages, we gained:\nComplete control over server configuration Ability to run server-side scripts Custom nginx configurations Direct SSH access for maintenance Better performance metrics Monitoring and Maintenance Health Check Output Example ================================================ Blog Health Check - Tue Aug 26 08:04:38 AM UTC 2025 ================================================ ✓ Site HTTPS Accessibility: OK (HTTP 200) ✓ SSL Certificate Status: Valid (Expires: Nov 21) ✓ Critical Files: All present ✓ Internal Link Check: No broken links ✓ Site Response Time: Fast (84ms) ✓ Disk Space: OK (9% used) ✓ Content Freshness: Fresh (0 days since last post) ✓ AI Crawler Access: AI crawlers allowed ✓ Page Weight: Lightweight (7KB) Summary: Blog is in perfect health! Continuous Improvement The automated SEO optimizer runs daily, continuously:\nUpdating llms-full.txt with new content Optimizing sitemap priorities Adding structured data to new posts Checking for broken links Ensuring AI optimization standards are met Conclusion This journey from a broken DNS configuration to a fully automated, AI-optimized blog demonstrates the importance of:\nProper diagnosis before implementation Research-driven decisions (choosing Hugo over Ghost) AI-first thinking in modern web development Automation for maintenance and optimization Monitoring for continuous health The result is a blog thats not just live, but optimized for the future of search - where AI assistants are the primary discovery mechanism.\nTechnical Stack Summary Server: Hetzner Ubuntu VPS Web Server: Nginx 1.24.0 Static Site Generator: Hugo 0.148.2 Extended Theme: PaperMod Version Control: Git + GitHub CI/CD: GitHub Actions SSL: Lets Encrypt (Certbot) Monitoring: Custom bash scripts with cron DNS: Porkbun with A records Resources and Links Live Blog: https://emino.app GitHub Repository: https://github.com/eminogrande/emino-blog llms.txt Specification: Proposed by Jeremy Howard Hugo Documentation: https://gohugo.io PaperMod Theme: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod Final Thoughts Building an AI-optimized blog isnt just about following best practices - its about understanding how AI systems discover and process content. By implementing llms.txt, structured data, and clear content hierarchies, weve created a blog that speaks the language of AI while remaining valuable for human readers.\nThe automation ensures the blog stays healthy and optimized without manual intervention, while the monitoring provides peace of mind that everything continues to work as expected.\nThis real-world implementation, complete with its challenges and solutions, shows that setting up an AI-optimized blog is achievable with the right approach and tools.\n","wordCount":"2003","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-08-25T16:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-08-25T16:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/building-ai-optimized-blog-complete-guide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
