This post documents how it all fits together, how swaps flow through the system, where the 0.3% “margin” comes from, and how a solver operator can deposit, monitor, and eventually withdraw profits.\n———\n1. High‑Level Overview At a high level we have four pieces:\nUser UI (emino.app) /intent/ – simple mobile‑first page to start a BTC ↔ EURe swap. /intent/intend/ – advanced JSON tester + history of swaps started through this server. UI Server (port 4100) Express server that: Serves the static HTML/JS for /intent/ and /intent/intend/. Exposes a small API: POST /api/intend/btc-to-eure POST /api/intend/eure-to-btc GET /api/intend/history GET /api/intend/status/:depositAddress Talks to the Defuse 1‑Click API (https://1click.chaindefuser.com) for quotes and status. NEAR Intents + Solver Relay NEAR Intents contract (intents.near) holds token reserves and tracks intents. Solver Relay (wss://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/ws) forwards quote requests from 1‑Click to solvers and receives their responses. Our AMM Solver Runs the official near-intents-amm-solver code with: AMM_TOKEN1_ID = nep141:gnosis-0x420ca0f9b9b604ce0fd9c18ef134c705e5fa3430.omft.near (EURe on Gnosis). AMM_TOKEN2_ID = nep141:btc.omft.near (BTC on NEAR). Maintains a constant‑product AMM over the EURe/BTC reserves on the Intents contract. Listens to quote requests via WebSocket, calculates prices with a margin, signs NEP‑413 quotes, and updates its view of reserves after intents execute. The UI and the solver are decoupled. The UI talks only to 1‑Click; the solver talks only to the solver relay + NEAR. The relay + 1‑Click route quotes and intents between them.\n———\n2. The User Experience: /intent/ and /intent/intend/ /intent/: Mobile‑First Swap UI This is meant to be the “one‑screen” test UI:\nTwo tabs:\nBTC → EURe EURe → BTC Fields:\nFor BTC → EURe:\nAmount you send (satoshis) – BTC in sats. EURe receiver (Gnosis EVM) – EVM address on Gnosis. BTC refund address – Bitcoin bech32 address. For EURe → BTC:\nAmount you send (EURe) – EURe amount, decimal. BTC receiver address – BTC address to receive the swap. EURe refund (Gnosis EVM) – EVM address for EURe refund. We prefill it with your own addresses:\nDEFAULT_EURE_EVM = 0x196C28928b1386D8Dcd32ab223bECcce6f731264 DEFAULT_BTC_ADDR = 1LBiZCtkByR3BuH7K3RJA15fmri84NW6CT\nWhen you click “Get deposit \u0026 start swap”:\nThe UI calls either: POST /api/intend/btc-to-eure POST /api/intend/eure-to-btc The server calls 1‑Click /v0/quote with swapType: EXACT_INPUT. On success, you get: amountInFormatted (nice units). amountOutFormatted (approx receive). A depositAddress on BTC or Gnosis. A deadline. The UI shows: A summary (“You send / You receive”). The deposit address. A QR code for wallet apps. A “status pill” that polls execution via GET /api/intend/status/:depositAddress. /intent/intend/: Advanced Tester This page is for debugging and power users:\nQuick test buttons: “Test: 10,000 sats → EURe” “Test: 10 EURe → BTC” A custom form similar to /intent/ but with simple text inputs. On every quote attempt: Shows a success box with the same info as /intent/.\nOr shows the raw error from 1‑Click, including:\n{ “message”: “…”, “status”: 400, “bodyMessage”: “Failed to get quote”, “correlationId”: “…”, “requestBody”: { …full JSON sent to /v0/quote… } }\nAt the bottom, a “Recent swaps (this server)” section: Backed by GET /api/intend/history. Based purely on swaps initiated via this UI/server. Shows direction, timestamp, amount in/out, and deposit address. ———\n3. The UI Server: Intents \u0026 History The server (server/index.ts) runs on port 4100 and does three things:\nQuote + Intend endpoints (EXACT_INPUT)\nPOST /api/intend/btc-to-eure: Validates amountInSats, recipientEvm, refundBtc. Calls quoteExactInputBtcToEure which uses 1‑Click’s getQuote with: originAsset = nep141:btc.omft.near destinationAsset = EURe amount = satsIn refundTo = refundBtc (BTC). recipient = recipientEvm (Gnosis). Returns deposit address + amounts. POST /api/intend/eure-to-btc: Validates amountInEure, recipientBtc, refundEvm. Converts EURe decimal → 18‑decimals (toUnits). Calls getQuote with origin/destination reversed. For each successful intend quote, it appends an IntentLogItem to an in‑memory intentLog:\ntype IntentLogItem = { direction: ‘btc-to-eure’ | ’eure-to-btc’; depositAddress: string; createdAt: string; amountIn: string; amountInFormatted: string; amountOut: string; amountOutFormatted: string; test?: boolean; recipient?: string; refund?: string; };\nHistory APIs\nGET /api/intend/history: Returns intentLog sorted newest‑first. GET /api/intend/history/:depositAddress: Returns: The log entry for that deposit (if any), and The execution status from 1‑Click getExecutionStatus. Status proxy\nGET /api/intend/status/:depositAddress: Straight proxy to 1‑Click getExecutionStatus, used by /intent/ to update the status pill. ———\n4. The AMM Solver: How We Provide Liquidity The solver is the official NEAR Intents AMM implementation, configured for EURe ↔ BTC:\nTokens:\nAMM_TOKEN1_ID = nep141:gnosis-0x420ca0f9b9b604ce0fd9c18ef134c705e5fa3430.omft.near (EURe) AMM_TOKEN2_ID = nep141:btc.omft.near (BTC)\nEnvironment highlights:\nNEAR_ACCOUNT_ID = nuri-solver.near NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY = ed25519:… RELAY_WS_URL = wss://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/ws ONE_CLICK_API_ONLY = true MARGIN_PERCENT = 0.3\nBehavior:\nOn startup: Connects to NEAR using near-api-js. Loads reserves of EURe \u0026 BTC from the Intents contract. Computes a deterministic nonce from reserves. Via WebSocket: Subscribes to: QUOTE events (incoming quote requests). QUOTE_STATUS events (executed intents). Filters quotes only for the EURe/BTC pair. For each quote request: Checks it’s from a trusted partner (partner_id = 1click or router-solver). Computes the AMM price with margin. Builds a NEP‑413 signed payload and sends a quote_response back to the relay. The AMM math is constant‑product (x · y = k) with margin:\nFor EXACT_INPUT (user specifies amount in):\namountInWithFee = amountIn * (1 – margin) out = (amountInWithFee * reserveOut) / (reserveIn + amountInWithFee)\nFor EXACT_OUTPUT (if used):\nin = reserveIn * out / ((reserveOut – out) * (1 – margin))\nThe margin is set by MARGIN_PERCENT (0.3 by default).\n———\n5. How a BTC → EURe Swap Flows End‑to‑End Take a BTC → EURe swap from the /intent/ UI:\nUser requests a quote UI sends POST /api/intend/btc-to-eure with: amountInSats recipientEvm refundBtc UI server calls 1‑Click /v0/quote with swapType: EXACT_INPUT. 1‑Click asks solvers 1‑Click forwards a quote request to the solver relay. Relay broadcasts to all solvers that support the btc.omft.near → EURe pair. Our solver answers Our solver sees a QUOTE event for nep141:btc.omft.near → EURe. It: Logs the request into recent_quotes. Computes an EURe output with margin = 0.3%. Signs a NEP‑413 quote. Sends quote_response back to the relay. 1‑Click picks a quote Once it has a quote, 1‑Click returns to our UI server: The depositAddress (usually a BTC address). amountIn, amountOut, formatted fields. The UI server saves this in intentLog. User pays The user sends BTC to the deposit address. 1‑Click’s internal machinery: Observes the BTC payment. Creates a NEAR intent targeting intents.near. Communicates with the relay and our solver quote to execute the swap. Sends EURe on Gnosis to recipientEvm. Status updates UI polls GET /api/intend/status/:depositAddress every 5 seconds. Solver receives QUOTE_STATUS events for intents that involve its quote and: Updates its reserves snapshot. Logs them into recent_intents. Monitoring On emino.app/solver/ the dashboard shows: Reserves (our liquidity on intents.near). Recent quotes and intents that went through the relay. “Recent Swaps (via emino.app UI)” pulled from /api/intend/history. ———\n6. How the 0.3% Margin Generates Revenue MARGIN_PERCENT = 0.3 means the solver takes 0.3% spread on each swap, implemented inside the AMM.\nFor BTC → EURe: The solver effectively takes 0.3% of the BTC input as “fee” and only uses 99.7% of it to compute how much EURe to send. That extra 0.3% stays inside the BTC reserve. For EURe → BTC: The fee is taken from the EURe input; 0.3% of EURe stays in the EURe reserve. Over many swaps:\nBoth EURe and BTC reserves grow relative to what a fee‑less AMM would have. That growth equals the cumulative margin – your solver revenue – minus any losses from adverse price movements. You can think of it as being the market maker: you earn the spread (0.3%) but carry the risk if BTC/ EURe price moves. ———\n7. In Which Currency Do We Earn? On each individual swap, the margin is paid in the asset the user sends:\nBTC → EURe: Margin is in BTC; your BTC reserve goes up slightly more than it would without fees. EURe → BTC: Margin is in EURe; your EURe reserve goes up. Over time:\nYou accumulate extra BTC when users send BTC and extra EURe when users send EURe. Your profit lives inside the reserves on the Intents contract. The solver dashboard’s “Reserves (on intents contract)” card shows those reserves in human units (EURe and BTC) so you can see at a glance how much liquidity – and implicitly profit – is sitting in the pool.\n———\n8. Depositing and Withdrawing Liquidity The AMM solver expects you to fund reserves in NEAR Intents before running:\nPreparation\nMake sure your solver account (e.g. nuri-solver.near) has: EURe tokens (on NEAR, the wrapped EURe). BTC tokens (btc.omft.near) on NEAR. Add the solver’s public key to intents.near (so it can sign quotes). Depositing tokens to Intents\nUsing NEAR CLI (simplified outline):\nDeposit EURe to intents.near on behalf of nuri-solver.near. Deposit BTC to intents.near similarly. The exact commands depend on the NEP‑141 FT contracts you use (ft_transfer_call / storage_deposit), and are described in NEAR Intents’ and the AMM solver’s README. Conceptually, you’re moving tokens from your solver account into a reserve position on the Intents contract.\nRunning the solver\nOnce reserves are in place:\nAMM_TOKEN1_ID=…EURe… AMM_TOKEN2_ID=nep141:btc.omft.near NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=nuri-solver.near NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:… RELAY_WS_URL=wss://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/ws APP_PORT=4010 MARGIN_PERCENT=0.3 ONE_CLICK_API_ONLY=true\nnpm start\nWhen the solver starts:\nemino.app/solver/ shows: Health = READY Reserves = non‑zero EURe \u0026 BTC. Total supply, recent quotes/intents. Withdrawing / Taking Profit\nTo realize profits, you can:\nReduce your reserve position on intents.near: Withdraw part of the EURe/BTC reserves back to nuri-solver.near. Bridge assets out: Withdraw BTC from the NEAR BTC token into on‑chain BTC. Withdraw EURe back to Gnosis, if desired. Again, the exact commands depend on the FT bridges and Intents tooling, but the principle is: the “extra” BTC/EURe that has accumulated in the reserves (vs. your initial deposit) is your PnL.\n———\n9. Monitoring: emino.app/solver/ The solver dashboard is designed to answer three questions:\nIs our solver healthy and connected? Health card: ready: true/false Solver account (ours): nuri-solver.near Websocket card: Connection to relay (CONNECTED / DISCONNECTED). Last relay event timestamp. What liquidity do we have and what’s happening on NEAR? Reserves: EURe \u0026 BTC reserves in human units. “Our liquidity on intents.near for this solver”. Total supply: Global EURe/BTC supply on NEAR Intents (all solvers). What activity is flowing through us vs. the network? Recent Quotes (ours): Only quotes calculated and signed by this solver. Recent Swaps (via emino.app UI): History from GET /api/intend/history. Exactly what you see on /intent/intend/. Recent Intents (network): All intents observed via the relay. Rows with asset/amount filled are intents that match our own quotes. Recent Intents (details): Same intents but with full hashes and timestamps for deep debugging. Together, this gives you:\n“How busy is our solver?” “Are quotes being accepted and executed?” “Are users actually swapping via our UI?” “How much liquidity do we still have?” ———\n10. Where to Go Next Now that everything is wired and functioning end‑to‑end, we can iterate in a few directions:\nBetter pricing policies Adjust MARGIN_PERCENT by pair, size, or volatility. Use external price feeds to keep the AMM centered around a fair price. More pairs Add additional tokens to the same solver or run multiple solvers. Richer UI Let users pick different swap sizes and see slippage and effective price. Add “expert mode” with raw request/response JSON embedded. For now, we already have:\nA fully working BTC ↔ EURe cross‑chain swap via NEAR Intents \u0026 1‑Click. A custom AMM solver earning 0.3% margin on each swap. Monitoring, history, and a clean separation between “our” data and the broader NEAR Intents network. Feel free to share this post with anyone who wants to understand how the system works under the hood or is curious how a solver can actually make money providing liquidity.\nPost created via email from emin@nuri.com\n","wordCount":"1955","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-06T18:35:01Z","dateModified":"2025-12-06T18:35:01Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emin Henri Mahrt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://emino.app/posts/building-a-cross-chain-btc-eure-market-maker-with-near-inten/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Art \u0026 Articles by Emin Mahrt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://emino.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://emino.app/ accesskey=h title="Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt (Alt + H)">Art & Articles by Emin Mahrt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
