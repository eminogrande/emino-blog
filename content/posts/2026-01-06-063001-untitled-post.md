## Notes

A quick note for now: this post is a snapshot — a small anchor for an idea/image that I want to return to.

If you’re reading this later: I’ll expand it with more context (why it mattered, what I learned, and what changed after).
## Context

A short post for now — I’ll add more detail and links when I revisit this.
